"""config.v1 preflight — the shared boot-time deployment-config validator (ADR-0026).

CANONICAL COPY: ``deploy/contracts/config.v1/preflight.py``. Every adopted service vendors this
file VERBATIM as ``config_preflight.py`` next to its ``config.v1.json`` declaration —
``gate:config-contract`` enforces byte-equality — so the module is importable inside every image
without a cross-domain package dependency (P2: the services stay isolated bricks; they share a
contract, not a code distribution).

The three declaration classes (see the contract README):

* **required-explicit** — unset/empty at boot ⇒ :class:`ConfigError` (the deploy refuses to boot
  with ONE message naming every missing key — fail loud, P18/ADR-0010);
* **defaulted** — the documented code default applies; nothing to enforce at boot;
* **capability** — the key belongs to a named capability whose tri-state is computed from the env:
  ``configured`` / ``not_configured`` / ``misconfigured`` (mode=all: some-but-not-all keys set).
  The service RUNS either way; capability-gated endpoints consult :func:`capability_state` and fail
  loud with a typed, actionable error; ``/health`` exposes the rows via :func:`capability_health`
  (ADDITIVE — existing health consumers keep working).

A capability may also declare a **live probe** (contract ``$defs/Probe``): one cheap verification
that the SET values actually work — an authenticated HTTP call (``http``: an unauthorized answer or
a network failure ⇒ misconfigured; any other status ⇒ the credential was accepted) or a credentials
FILE check (``file``: regular readable non-empty JSON ⇒ ok; a directory — docker's bind-mount of a
MISSING host path — or unreadable/non-JSON ⇒ misconfigured). Probes run only when the env-level
state is already ``configured``: once at boot (logged, never boot-blocking) and lazily on ``/health``
when the cached result is older than the probe's ``ttl_s``. This is what turns the silent-401 STT
token and the absent claude-credentials mount into a visible ``misconfigured`` row BEFORE any
meeting/agent runs.

Any declaration class may also carry **forbidden_values** — the placeholder literals a stock deploy
surface once supplied. A boot whose env holds one raises :class:`ConfigError` beside the missing-key
refusal, because an unconfigured secret that LOOKS configured is the worse of the two failures: the
service comes up green and the value is in the public repository (F95).

Env-level state is computed AT CALL TIME (no boot-time snapshot), so tests monkeypatching the
environment and long-lived processes both observe the truth.
