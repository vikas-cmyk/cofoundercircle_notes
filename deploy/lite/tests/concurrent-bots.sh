# concurrent-bots.sh — the release smoke test, and the SOLE ISSUER of the
# `release/vm-validated` commit status.
#
# WHY THIS TEST: #478 shipped because release verification only ever ran ONE
# bot — the shared-profile SingletonLock death needs ≥2 concurrent bots to
# show. This script is that missing check, runnable against the PUBLISHED
# image on a clean host (the stranger's own path):
#
#   IMAGE_TAG=v0.12.0 make lite          # bring the stack up from the Hub image
#   deploy/lite/tests/concurrent-bots.sh # then prove N bots launch concurrently
#
# PASS = all N bots reach `joining` and their browsers stay alive through the
# window, each on its OWN profile dir, zero SingletonLock signatures.
#
# Posting the attestation (optional, from a checkout with `gh` authed):
#   POST_STATUS=1 GIT_SHA=<released sha> deploy/lite/tests/concurrent-bots.sh
# posts release/vm-validated success/failure on that sha with this run's
# summary. Branch protection requires the context, so a release merge is
# impossible without a green run of this script — that is the enforcement.
