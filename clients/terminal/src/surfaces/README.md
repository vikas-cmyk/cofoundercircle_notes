# surfaces

One contributed module per surface. Each file `registerSurface`s its activity-bar item + view(s) (and
optional `onSubmit`/commands); `index.tsx` is the barrel whose import triggers registration. The shell
(`../workbench/`) renders whatever is registered — adding a surface is a new file + a barrel import,
never an edit to the shell (P2/P6). Real today: `chat` (MVP0), `workspace` (MVP1), `tasks` + `routines`
(MVP2). Placeholders (Live/Inbox/Calendar) keep the activity bar complete until their MVP.

**`workspace.tsx` is the live-collaboration surface** — the KNOWLEDGE panel (full workspace tree, the
`_system` key toggle, cross-workspace search), per-mount sections, the aggregated SOURCE CONTROL
RECENT ACTIVITY feed (email-attributed, clickable files), the "new updates" nav badge
(`updatesBadge.ts` + the Workbench poll), doc auto-reload + one-click **Changes** diff, README
auto-pin on shared connect, and the Share/invite dialog (single-rank). The end-to-end model is in
**[`docs/docs/core/workspaces.mdx`](../../../../docs/docs/core/workspaces.mdx)**.

**Calendars are plural** (`calendarConnections.tsx`, the plural `/user/calendars` API — see
[`docs/docs/api/calendar.mdx`](../../../../docs/docs/api/calendar.mdx)). An account holds up to ten
named ICS connections, each with its own `enabled` flag, auto-join policy and bot name. There is ONE
manager — Settings → Calendar (list · add · rename · replace feed · pause · disconnect · sync-one);
the Meetings rail popover (`meeting.tsx`) and the first-run card (`meetingsOnboarding.tsx`) are the
point-of-need skins over the same API and defer everything else to Settings. Three invariants the
tests pin: the feed address is **write-only** (the API returns `ics_url_set` + a recognition mask, and
no input is ever prefilled from the server), the ten-connection cap is stated in the UI rather than
arriving as a surprise 409, and a write that changes what gets joined (`auto_join` · `bot_name` ·
`enabled` · a replaced `ics_url`) is followed by the per-calendar sync that reconciles
already-imported meetings — a rename is not, because it changes nothing downstream.

**Error presentation is part of the surface contract** — surfaces render `presentError(e)`
(`apiClient.ts`), never `e.message`: the headline is user vocabulary ("Couldn't reach the Vexa
server…", the backend's own prose reason verbatim when it sent one), while the untranslated
plumbing string stays on the operator channels (the returned `detail` and a `console.warn`). The
raw idiom `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)` is banned from surface files by
`__tests__/errorPresentation.guard.test.ts`. State-bearing controls (the meeting header's
Stop/Send bot) additionally follow the live ws.v1 connection (`useLiveMeetingsConnection`):
disconnected → indeterminate/disabled, never an actionable control derived from a stale snapshot.
