/** apiClient — the ONE fail-loud HTTP helper for the terminal's scoped data-access (P18).
 *
 *  A non-ok response (4xx/5xx — e.g. a backend 422, or the gateway down → 502) or a network failure
 *  THROWS `ApiError` with the status + detail, instead of being swallowed into empty data. That is the
 *  whole point: a failure must PROPAGATE to the surface and be shown to the user — never hidden as
 *  "no data" (which is exactly what made this session's stale-backend 422s and dry STT invisible).
 *  A legit-empty result (a 200 whose body is `[]`/`{}`) is NOT an error and returns normally.
 *
 *  Being the single client→API chokepoint, this is also where we report API usage to Google Analytics
 *  (one `api_request` event per call: normalized endpoint · method · status · ok). GA is opt-in, so the
 *  track() call no-ops unless a measurement id was configured. NOTE: this captures only WEB-CLIENT calls
 *  — the authoritative cross-caller API-usage signal is the gateway's per-request logs. */
