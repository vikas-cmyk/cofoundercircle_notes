/** chatStream — the resumable SSE reader for a chat turn (POST /api/chat).
 *
 *  Why this exists as its own unit: a chat turn spawns a FRESH per-dispatch agent worker (docker
 *  backend) that takes several seconds to boot before its first token. If the SSE closes during that
 *  cold-start window — or drops mid-turn on a transient proxy/network blip — the turn is NOT lost: the
 *  worker completes + commits, and its output Stream is DURABLE and id-addressable (agent-api surfaces
 *  each event's Stream cursor as the SSE `id:`). So instead of declaring "No chat output arrived before
 *  the stream closed" the moment a stream ends early, we RESUME from the last-seen cursor (Last-Event-ID)
 *  and keep rendering — gapless, mirroring /api/meeting/stream. Only a genuinely stuck turn (no output
 *  and no clean end well past a normal cold start) or a real upstream error surfaces a failure.
 *
 *  Extracted from Chat.send so the robustness logic is unit-testable against a faked fetch/SSE. */
