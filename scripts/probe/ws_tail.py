"""ws_tail.py — subscribe to the gateway ``/ws`` feed and record every frame as JSONL.

The probe's live-transcript listener: it REUSES the stdlib WebSocket client the compose
stack proof already carries (``deploy/compose/tests/_ws.py``) — the probe invents no new
client. ``journey.sh`` starts it BEFORE spawning the bot, so live transcript frames are
caught the moment the collector fans them out, and greps the JSONL afterwards.

usage: ws_tail.py <gateway_url> <api_key> <platform> <native_id> <seconds> <out_file>

Writes one JSON object per line (the ``subscribed`` ack first, then each frame).
Exits 0 iff the subscribe ack arrived.
