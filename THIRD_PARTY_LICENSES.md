# Third-party licenses — baked artifacts outside the dependency gate

`gate:licenses` (ADR-0004, `scripts/gates.mjs`) scans the resolved **npm** dependency
tree (`pnpm licenses list --json`) and the Python tree grows into `pip-licenses`. Neither
sees **non-dependency artifacts baked into the images** — model weights pulled from a model
hub, or a service binary built from source at image-build time. This file is the
packaging-side complement: every such artifact is recorded here with its license, mirrored
into the per-release SPDX SBOM (`scripts/sbom.mjs`), and — for baked binaries and pinned
container images — audited by **`gate:image-licenses`** against
[`image-licenses.json`](image-licenses.json) (#653).

The verbatim upstream license for each entry lives under [`licenses/`](licenses/) and is
copied into the image next to the artifact it covers, so the notice travels with the bytes.

The SPDX also inventories every package name in the Lite Dockerfile's final-stage `apt install`.
That is a source-level inventory: Docker source does not resolve Ubuntu package versions or
package licences, so those fields are emitted as `NOASSERTION` until an image-level scanner
enriches them. Builder-stage packages that do not cross into the final image are excluded.

## Baked service binaries

| Artifact | Version | License | Source | Baked into | In-image path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `valkey` | `8.1.9` | BSD-3-Clause | [github.com/valkey-io/valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) | `vexaai/vexa-lite` | `/usr/local/bin/valkey-server`, `/usr/local/share/valkey/LICENSE` |

**`valkey`** — the internal cache / stream store (bus, scheduler, per-dispatch streams). Lite
builds `valkey-server` + `valkey-cli` from the pinned git tag in the `valkey-builder` stage of
[`deploy/lite/Dockerfile.lite`](deploy/lite/Dockerfile.lite) (glibc-matched to the final image;
an alpine/musl binary can't run there) and copies them onto `PATH`. Valkey is the Linux
Foundation's BSD-3-Clause fork of Redis 7.2.4 — it has `XAUTOCLAIM` (parity with compose/helm)
and keeps Lite off both jammy apt's stale Redis 6.0.16 and source-available Redis ≥7.4
(RSALv2/SSPLv1). compose and helm pin `valkey/valkey:8-alpine` (operator-pulled, recorded in
[`image-licenses.json`](image-licenses.json)). Full text:
[`licenses/valkey-8.1.9.COPYING.txt`](licenses/valkey-8.1.9.COPYING.txt).

> BSD-3-Clause is a Category-A (permissive) license under ADR-0004; baking it requires no

## Baked model weights

| Artifact | Version (revision) | License | Source | Baked into | In-image path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0` | `main` | MIT | [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0) | `vexaai/vexa-bot`, `vexaai/vexa-lite` | `/opt/hf-cache/LICENSE.pyannote-segmentation-3.0` |

**`onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0`** — the mixed (Zoom/Teams) speaker-diarization
lane segments speakers with this model, loaded OFFLINE from an image-baked HuggingFace cache
at `/opt/hf-cache` (see [`warm-hf-cache.mjs`](core/meetings/services/bot/warm-hf-cache.mjs)).
It is an ONNX conversion of the gated [`pyannote/segmentation-3.0`](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0);
the conversion is published MIT and **not** gated. The model card ships no LICENSE file of
its own, so the preserved notice is the [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)
project's MIT license (`Copyright (c) 2020 CNRS`), whose copyright governs the weights. Full
text: [`licenses/onnx-community-pyannote-segmentation-3.0.LICENSE.txt`](licenses/onnx-community-pyannote-segmentation-3.0.LICENSE.txt).
