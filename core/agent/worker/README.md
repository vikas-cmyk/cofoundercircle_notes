# agent · worker

The agent worker: runs a single agent workload to completion. Owns the generic turn engine
(`engine`), the per-meeting loop (`meeting`, `meeting_transcript_mcp`), and its container image
(`Dockerfile`). Model/harness access goes through the provider-agnostic [`llm`](../llm) ports —
card beats via `CompletionPort` (a direct HTTP completion), workspace turns via `HarnessPort` (the
`VEXA_RUNNER`-selected CLI agent); no vendor name lives in this package. Spawned by the control
plane; liveness = workload lifecycle.
