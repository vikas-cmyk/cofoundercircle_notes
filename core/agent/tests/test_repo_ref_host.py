"""What a caller-supplied "Repository" may be — the gate that runs BEFORE git does.

``POST /api/workspace/swap`` and ``POST /api/workspace/activate`` hand the ``repo`` field to
``git clone``, which is a fetch THIS SERVER performs. Two things follow, and each has its own half of
this file:

* the HOST must be one the caller could have reached themselves — otherwise the attach dialog is a
  server-side request forge against the deployment's own network (R-D15);
* the TRANSPORT must be one we named — ``ext::`` runs a shell command and ``file://`` reads this
  host's disk, and both are well-formed git URLs.

The load-bearing assertion in the first half is not the error: it is that **no subprocess ever ran**.
A validator that fires after git has already been told where to go has not protected anything, so
every refusal test monkeypatches ``subprocess.run``/``Popen`` and asserts the call count is zero.
