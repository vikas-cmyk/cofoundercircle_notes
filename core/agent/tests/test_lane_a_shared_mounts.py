"""Lane A (slim slice) — membership → shared mount in the active set.

The linchpin seam: a workspace the subject is a MEMBER of shows up in their ACTIVE SET (what the
dispatch mounts + what the terminal's readActiveSet()/KNOWLEDGE panel renders), with write gated by
role. Offline L2 tests over the real git-backed policy/members.json + the in-memory index — no docker,
no runtime, no DB. Reuses the Lane M scaffolding (_init_ws, grant_membership, InMemoryMembershipIndex).
