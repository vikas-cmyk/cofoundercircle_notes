"""events.py — the event ingress mapper (event.v1 → unit.v1 DISPATCH).

Generic + tool-agnostic. An external event becomes a ``unit.v1`` dispatch and the SAME Dispatcher fans
it out — a new source is a new ``name``, not a new code path. agent-api knows NOTHING about
email / calendar / news: those are TOOLS the unit reaches through its toolbelt, never primitives here.
The Event carries an OPAQUE ``source`` ref; the plan (carried inline on the Event, or — later — by a
matching event-routine) tells the unit which tool to RESOLVE it with. No domain bytes cross this seam.

An event is **untrusted** input (attacker-controllable) ⇒ the dispatch mounts the workspace ``ro`` and
the agent proposes (governance derives this from the trigger via ``units.mode_for``).
