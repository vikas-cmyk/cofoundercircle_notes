"""system_mounts.py — the two SYSTEM TIERS of the three-tier mount stack (AMENDMENT 4).

Every agent worker turn mounts a STACK, not one workspace. The stack is a LIST (never special-cased
slots) with three tiers, and this module owns the two system tiers that bracket the subject's normal
active set (the ``_global`` read-only base and the ``_system`` per-user private base):

  1. ``/workspaces/_global``  GLOBAL SYSTEM — platform-owned, READ-ONLY, ALWAYS mounted into EVERY worker.
        Behaviour (CLAUDE.md-level instructions), shared skills, common tools, base knowledge. Agents
        never write it (the mount is ``write=False`` → the runtime binds it ``:ro``). A LIVE MOUNT, not a
        seed: updating the one _global repo propagates to all agents next turn. Source = an env-configured
        path (``GLOBAL_SYSTEM_WORKSPACE_PATH``, config.v1-declared). Mount HEAD; a pinned ref is supported
        via ``GLOBAL_SYSTEM_WORKSPACE_REF`` (default the repo's HEAD/main). ABSENT (unconfigured, or the
        configured path does not exist) → SKIP the mount and log; the stack degrades to _system + active.

  2. ``/workspaces/_system``  PRIVATE SYSTEM — per-user, READ-WRITE, ALWAYS mounted. Chats/sessions,
        settings, routines, membership/attachment records, credential refs. Private, never shareable.
        CREATE-IF-ABSENT from a THIN template (layout only; behaviour lives in _global). Chats MIGRATE
        here in a LATER WP — this WP only establishes the mount.

The normal active set (WP-A2.1: the subject's private baseline + activated extras) sits BETWEEN these as
the middle tier; ``dispatch.build_mount_set`` composes the full stack ``[_global?, *active, _system]``.

Pure + path-driven so the mount stack is unit-tested offline (no docker/kubectl): both builders take a
``workspaces_dir`` root + settings-like knobs and return the ``{slug, path, role, write, primary}`` mount
dicts the runtime backends already understand (an out-of-store ``_global`` path becomes its own bind; the
in-store ``_system`` path rides the store-root bind — see ``runtime_kernel.mounts``).
