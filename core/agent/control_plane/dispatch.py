"""dispatch.py — the unit dispatcher: turn a ``unit.v1`` DISPATCH into a runtime.v1 agent container.

Every trigger source (chat *now*, scheduled, event, transcription) funnels through ONE
``Dispatcher.dispatch``. It mints the per-dispatch identity token (``IdentityPort``), derives the
workload id + the output Stream, builds the worker ``env``, and asks the **Runtime** to spawn an
ISOLATED container. Agents **never** run in the control plane — isolation is the enforcement of the
governance, so there is no in-process path. Quota keys on the PERSON (``VEXA_OWNER`` = subject).

The runtime kernel runs ``profile`` + ``env`` opaquely; the worker reads its env (mounted workspaces,
the minted token, ``REDIS_URL`` + the ``unit:<id>:in/out`` topics, the ``start``) and runs the turn.
