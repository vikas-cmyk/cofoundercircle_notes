"""workspace_publish.py — publish a VEXA-BORN workspace to GitHub (the counterpart of attach/swap).

A workspace that was seeded inside vexa has real git history but no home of its own. *Publish* gives
it one: create a repo under the caller's GitHub account (or an org they can create in) and push the
active workspace's current branch — full history — to it. An attached workspace (workspace_attach)
already HAS a home; publishing it is refused so the flow never shadows the user's own origin.

Credential discipline (P15 — mirrors ``POST /api/workspace/swap``): the GitHub token arrives PER
CALL in the request body, is used server-side for exactly two operations (the repo-creation API call
and the authenticated push), and is NEVER stored. The push itself goes through the shared
token-scrubbed remote mechanic (``shared.adapters.push_with_token``): a dedicated remote so the
workspace's ``origin`` is never clobbered, token on the remote URL only for the push's duration,
then scrubbed. Every error surfaced from here is token-redacted.

Re-publish is idempotent-ish: the same remote means a plain (fast-forward) push. NEVER a force push
— divergence surfaces as a clear, token-free error instead of rewriting the remote.
