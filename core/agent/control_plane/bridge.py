"""The meeting WS → agent bridge (O-AG-3).

The bridge is the meetings → agent control-plane edge. It subscribes the meetings transcript egress
(a bus delivering ``transcript.v1`` payloads), VALIDATES each one at the ``meetings ⊥ agent`` seam
— the transcript.v1 schema is read BY PATH (mirroring ``contracts.py``), NEVER by importing meetings
code — and, on a configured trigger, emits an ``invoke.v1`` Invocation and spawns the ``agent``
workload via the ``RuntimePort`` (env built by ``spawn.build_worker_env`` per ``spec-agent.json``).

A non-conformant payload is DROPPED at the seam: it never reaches the trigger logic or the runtime.
