"""transcription_watcher.py — the agent's IN-PROCESS inbound watch (trigger → arm) over the live transcript.

It runs ONE daemon thread, ARM (``_run_arm``): tail ``transcription_segments`` purely as a TRIGGER to do
the jobs only the agent-api can do — key the copilot on the meetings-domain numeric ROW id per meeting,
REGISTER the live meeting, RE-ARM the copilot dispatch while the user has processing enabled (spawn-or-touch,
idempotent), and on ``session_end`` reap the copilot + connect the meeting's kg doc.

P0 (cross-tenant leak fix): the transcript CARRIER + ``:on`` + ``:cursor`` + dispatch keys are the numeric
ROW id ``mid`` (unique per (user, platform, native, run)), NOT the native Meet code (which collides across
DIFFERENT users AND across ONE user's re-sends — keying transcript data by it leaked one user's transcript
to another). The native code is resolved best-effort for DISPLAY only (the kg doc/title + the ``native_id``
field); a resolution miss no longer diverges the carrier key.

It does NOT write the transcript carrier. The MEETINGS domain (meeting-api's collector) is the SINGLE
writer of the per-meeting feed ``tc:meeting:{row_id}`` and its ``session_end`` marker (P23) — the agent only
CONSUMES it. This loop is also the ONE dispatch arbiter for copilot processing (ADR 0027): /api/meeting/
process writes the desired-state flag only; the arm here resumes from the worker-advanced cursor
(``proc:meeting:{row_id}:cursor``, else 0-0) and relies on runtime.v1's idempotent create (a running
copilot is touched, never respawned). `meetings ⊥ agent` (P3): the agent re-derives nothing. ``keymap``
(numeric meeting_id → row-id routing key) is the arm thread's own state.

No extra container, no HTTP hop: it holds the Dispatcher directly.
