"""repo_ref.py — what a caller-supplied "Repository" may be, decided BEFORE any git process starts.

``POST /api/workspace/swap`` and ``POST /api/workspace/activate`` take a repository from the caller
and hand it to ``git clone``. ``git clone`` is a fetch **this server** performs, so the field is not
only a name for something the caller owns — it is an instruction to this process to go somewhere and
come back with the result. Two properties follow, and neither was true before this module existed:

* **the HOST must be somewhere the caller could have reached themselves.** ``http://169.254.169.254/a/b``
  is the cloud metadata service and ``http://admin-api:8001/a/b`` is a compose neighbour; both are
  perfectly well-formed repository URLs, and the outcome of the fetch comes back to the caller in the
  (token-redacted) clone error. ``assert_public_host`` is that half.
* **the TRANSPORT must be one we named.** ``ext::sh -c <command>`` is a git URL that runs a shell
  command, and ``file:///etc`` is a git URL that reads the local filesystem. ``assert_allowed_scheme``
  is that half, and ``shared.gitenv.pinned_git_env`` enforces the same list a second time inside git
  itself, so a transport we did not name cannot be reached even by a caller we did not anticipate.

Both checks run **before any subprocess is created**, which is the part that matters: a validator that
runs after git has already been told where to go has not protected anything.

The checks are duplicated — once at the route, once inside ``workspace_attach._git_clone`` — on
purpose, so a credential-bearing fetch cannot reach git through the MCP, a future route, or a test
that forgot.

**What this module does NOT close, stated plainly:** a DNS name that resolves to an internal address
(``localtest.me``, a rebinding record) passes ``_host_is_internal``, because the check is on the name
and the resolution happens inside git. Closing that needs resolution-time enforcement (resolve, check
every answer, pin the connection), which is a different mechanism than a string check.
