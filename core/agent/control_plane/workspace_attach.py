"""workspace_attach.py — attach a CUSTOM external git repo as a subject's workspace, swappable.

The active workspace a turn mounts is always ``<root>/<subject>``. A subject may *attach* their own
git repo (``workspace.v1`` is a user-owned repo) in place of the seeded default; that is a **swap**:

  * the currently-active workspace is *parked* (moved aside under ``<root>/.attached/<subject>/<slug>``)
    so it stays available to swap back to — nothing is destroyed,
  * the requested repo is *attached* by restoring a previously-parked clone of it, or — first time —
    cloning it fresh into ``<root>/<subject>``.

Swapping back is just swapping to a repo already parked: its slug matches, so the parked tree is moved
back into place with NO re-clone (local changes/commits the subject made while detached persist). The
original seeded workspace is parked under the reserved ``seed`` slug; pass ``repo_url=None`` to swap
back to it (restored if parked, else re-seeded from the template).

The store dir (``<root>/.attached``) is dot-prefixed, so it is invisible to ``scan_workspace_subjects``
and the Workspace tree (both skip dotnames) — parked workspaces never masquerade as subjects.
