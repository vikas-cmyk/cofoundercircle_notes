"""workspace_git_sync.py — GitHub push / pull / status for ANY workspace that has a home remote.

The counterpart to :mod:`workspace_publish` (which CREATES a GitHub home for a vexa-born workspace).
Once a workspace has an origin — either an ATTACHED clone (``origin``, kept token-free by
``workspace_attach``) or a vexa-born workspace that was PUBLISHED (the ``vexa-publish`` remote) — this
module keeps it in sync with that home:

- **push**  — fast-forward push of the current branch to the home remote (NEVER forces; a diverged
  remote fails loud). The token rides on the URL for the push's duration ONLY via the shared
  ``push_with_token`` mechanic, then is scrubbed (P15).
- **pull**  — fetch the home branch and FAST-FORWARD only. A divergence (local has commits the remote
  doesn't, or vice-versa with local changes) is reported as a conflict — no auto-merge, no rebase, no
  force — so the user resolves it deliberately, matching the push philosophy. The token is used for the
  fetch only and NEVER persisted (we fetch from the authenticated URL as an argument, so no remote or
  ``.git/config`` credential is ever written).
- **status** — ahead/behind counts against the last-known remote-tracking ref, computed LOCALLY (no
  network, no token) so the panel can render ``↑2 ↓1`` cheaply on every poll.

The "home remote" is resolved as ``origin`` first (attached clones), else ``vexa-publish`` (published
vexa-born workspaces) — so one code path serves both. Every error is token-redacted before it leaves.
