"""Ports (Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters — P5).

The core depends ONLY on these protocols — "holes" that adapters fill at the composition root.
A port is what lets the L2 unit test exist (ARCHITECTURE.md §5): every external thing the core
touches (a user's git repo, the runtime kernel, the transcript bus) is reached through one of
these, so the core stays offline-provable with in-memory fakes.

Each port is a pure ``Protocol`` — no transport, no I/O, no third-party import. The real adapters
(git, an HTTP client to runtime.v1, a redis transcript stream) live elsewhere and are wired in by
the service entrypoint; none of them is imported here.
