"""The agent-run core — transcript.v1 → governed action → (would-)commit to the workspace.

This is the inner hexagon: it depends only on the ports (``WorkspacePort``, ``RuntimePort``,
``AgentDecisionPort``) and the contract validators, never on a transport. That is what lets the L2
unit test drive it with in-memory fakes (ARCHITECTURE.md §5).

The wiring this core proves is GOVERNANCE around the decider, not the decider itself:
  1. read a transcript.v1 payload (validated at the seam),
  2. ask an ``AgentDecisionPort`` what to do (default: a DETERMINISTIC rule; the real LLM slots in
     behind the same seam, OUT OF SCOPE here), and
  3. re-validate the emitted write against workspace.v1 BEFORE it can touch the user repo — a
     decider (even a hallucinating LLM) cannot bypass the contract (P8) — then commit it.
