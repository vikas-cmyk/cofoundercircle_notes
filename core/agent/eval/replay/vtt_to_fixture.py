"""Parse YouTube auto-caption VTT → transcript.v1 fixture (JSONL of {speaker, text, start}).

Auto-captions are rolling (each cue repeats the prior line + a new one, with inline word tags) and have
NO speaker labels. We: (1) dedup to the flowing transcript, (2) split into sentences, (3) group into
~2-sentence turns, (4) assign best-effort speakers by rotating the known panel on a turn boundary
(heuristic — attribution is not real), (5) cap to a slice so the replay is a couple of minutes.
