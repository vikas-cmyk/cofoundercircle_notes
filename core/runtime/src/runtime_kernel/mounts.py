"""mounts.py — the runtime's workspace MOUNT-SET plumbing, shared by all three backends.

A dispatch carries an ORDERED mount set (agent-api WP-A1.1): the private baseline plus every workspace
the subject activated (WP-A2.1). The env delivers it in two layers, and this module turns BOTH into the
``(source, target)`` bind pairs a backend materializes — so the docker/k8s/process backends share ONE
mount-computing path instead of each open-coding it (and each special-casing "two"):

  * ``VEXA_WORKSPACE_MOUNT_SOURCE`` + ``VEXA_WORKSPACE_MOUNT_TARGET`` — the store BACKING bind: the host
    path / named volume that holds the whole workspace store, bound once at the store root. Every mount
    in the set lives UNDER this root today, so this single bind already exposes all N of them.
  * ``VEXA_MOUNTS`` — the ordered ``[{slug, path, role, write, primary}]`` set. ``path`` is the absolute
    container path of each active workspace. When a mount's path is NOT under the bound store root (a
    future shared workspace backed by a DIFFERENT store — later WPs), it needs its OWN bind; this module
    emits one per such out-of-store mount. In-store mounts add no extra bind (the root bind covers them).

The result is a de-duplicated, ORDER-PRESERVING list of ``MountBind(source, target, read_only)``. Pure +
env-driven, so all three backends are mount-tested offline with a plain env dict (no docker/kubectl).
