"""ProcessBackend — runs a workload as a child process (single-host / no Docker). The leanest real
backend; satisfies the runtime.v1 lifecycle. (docker/k8s backends are ported from 0.11 when needed.)

Output capture: each workload's stdout+stderr goes to a per-workload log file under
``PROCESS_LOG_DIR`` (default ``<tempdir>/vexa-workloads``) — the process analog of ``docker logs``.
A workload that exits nonzero gets its log tail surfaced at ERROR level through the runtime's own
logs the first time the exit is observed, so a crashed worker (e.g. an ImportError at startup) is
diagnosable from the runtime service logs instead of vanishing into /dev/null.

Group-scoped teardown: each workload is spawned as its own process-group leader
(``start_new_session=True`` → leader pid == pgid). Every path that ends a workload — an observed
self-exit, ``kill``/``cleanup``, and the kernel's stop sequence — signals the whole *group*
(``os.killpg``), so a workload's children (e.g. the bot's Chromium tree) are reaped with it instead
of being reparented to PID 1 and stranded on the shared host. Declared limitation: descendants that
detach into their OWN process group (the join module's debug-view x11vnc/websockify, spawned
``detached: true``) are out of any group signal's reach — a container/host restart still clears
those."""
