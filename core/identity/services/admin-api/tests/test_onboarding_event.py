"""`onboarding.completed` — published by IDENTITY, once, at the one point a person enters.

Founder ruling, 2026-09-02: this event triggers billing on the paid product. That makes it a
contract rather than a convenience, and it pins five things at once — one producer, an exact
payload, exactly-once, every configuration, and no agent code on the path.

WHY HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. Five independent paths onboard a person today: the control MCP's sign-in
verbs, its OAuth door, its shared `account_for` helper, the terminal's own auth, and the flows mail
door when an invite arrives from a stranger. None of them published anything, and three seeded a
desk inline. They look like five places to add an event — and they are not, because ALL FIVE create
the account through `POST /admin/users`. The single point they already share is where the fact
belongs, so nothing else had to be refactored to make this true.

FIRE-AND-FORGET, AND A PUBLISH EDGE IS NOT A DEPENDENCY. Identity does not call flows; it tells
flows. The publish is best-effort, bounded, and swallowed: a deployment with no flows domain still
onboards people, and so does one where flows is simply down. What may never happen is the reverse —
onboarding completing without the event — because that is a person who is signed in and has no seat.
