"""#526 · config.v1 (ADR-0026) — admin-api's declaration + boot preflight.

admin-api carries the fail-closed INTERNAL_API_SECRET guard (the /internal/validate endpoint), but
was OUTSIDE the config-contract machinery: a deploy missing the secret booted green and 503'd every
gateway validation hop — the 2026-04-23 shape (23 meetings failed while monitors stayed green).
This pins the declaration + the boot preflight that refuses that deploy. Offline, stdlib only.

    admin-api reads VEXA_FLOWS_API_URL and VEXA_FLOWS_API_KEY to hand `onboarding.completed` to
    flows. Every env read must be declared (check 5 of gate:config-contract), and the three classes
    that existed before this all describe a value the service NEEDS: required-explicit refuses the
    boot without it, defaulted supplies one, capability gates endpoints on it. Declaring a publish
    target as any of them asserts that the publisher depends on the consumer — the one thing it
    must not do, and the reason identity can be the domain everyone else depends on.

    So the class says the true thing instead, and the consequence is stated here rather than left
    to be inferred from the preflight's silence: a deployment that runs no flows domain boots
    exactly as one that does. The facts are dropped; nothing else changes."""
