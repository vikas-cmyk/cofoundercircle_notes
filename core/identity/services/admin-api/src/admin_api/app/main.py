"""The admin-api FastAPI surface — v0.12 carve of `services/admin-api/app/main.py`.

Derived (re-read, reimplemented clean) — the load-bearing identity surface that O-STACK-3
exercises:

  3 auth tiers (parent §):
    - admin   : `X-Admin-API-Key` == ADMIN_API_TOKEN (hmac.compare_digest)  → user/token CRUD
    - user    : `X-API-Key` resolves to an APIToken with a valid scope       → /user/* self-serve
    - internal: `X-Internal-Secret` == INTERNAL_API_SECRET, FAIL-CLOSED      → /internal/validate

  /internal/validate (the gateway's authz oracle): returns user_id + scopes + max_concurrent +
  email, plus webhook_url/secret/events from user.data; rejects expired tokens; bumps
  last_used_at; FAILS CLOSED when INTERNAL_API_SECRET is unset (503) and on a bad secret (403).

  Token mint: scoped {bot,tx,browser}. Scopes via JSON body `{"scopes":["bot","tx"]}` or
  query `?scopes=bot,tx` / `?scope=bot` (body wins when present). Optional `name` /
  `expires_in` in body or query; an invalid scope → 422. A JSON body with unknown fields
  is refused (422) — never silently dropped (#922).

      * two concurrent `POST /admin/users` with `Anna@x` and `anna@x` both miss the lookup and both

        index that would enforce one-address-one-account for good stays non-unique until an operator

        who still has those files (they lived in each person's workspace in the AGENT domain) POSTs
        each one here; `plan_import` decides, and its three rules are the migration's whole
        contract: a key the person has ALREADY set through the write door is KEPT (so the sweep is
        re-runnable across an estate where somebody has since changed a preference), `bot_name` goes
        into the BOT's own store and only when that store is empty (nobody's bot changes name in
        either direction), and an unknown key is DROPPED rather than refused (a migration that stops
        on one odd key leaves half the estate on the old store, and there is no second run that
        fixes that).

        ADMIN-TIER, not internal: it is an operator act on a named person, and the operator token is
        the credential an operator has. The response says what happened to every key — imported,
        kept, dropped — because a migration whose result you cannot read is a migration nobody can
        confirm ran."""
