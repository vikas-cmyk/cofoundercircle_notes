# app — the admin-api FastAPI surface

`main.py` exposes `create_app()` with 3 auth tiers (admin `X-Admin-API-Key`, user `X-API-Key`,
internal `X-Internal-Secret`) and the gateway's fail-closed `/internal/validate` oracle. `db.py`
builds an INJECTABLE async engine so the same app runs against testcontainers-PG or prod.

_Governed by `docs/docs/governance/architecture.mdx` (P1–P12). This folder owns one concern; its public surface is its `index`/contract; it may depend only on what the dependency-rules allow._
