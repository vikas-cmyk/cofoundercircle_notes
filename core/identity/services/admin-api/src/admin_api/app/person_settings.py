"""PERSON FACTS — the settings identity owns, and the only place they live.

WHY IDENTITY. These five keys are facts about a PERSON: which clock their times are stated in, and
how they want to be contacted. They lived in `.settings.json`, a file in a workspace in the AGENT
domain, written by the control MCP and read by flows. That made two domains depend on a third for a
fact about a person — so a deployment without the agent domain had people with no timezone and no
mail preferences, and flows could neither state a time in their clock nor honour "stop mailing me
minutes". Identity is the only domain everyone may depend on (founder ruling, 2026-09-02), and this
is the kind of fact that belongs to it.

WHAT IS NOT HERE, DELIBERATELY. `bot_name`. A bot default is a fact about the BOT, and the bot is
the meetings domain's — it already resolves one through `/internal/users/{id}/bot-context`. Adding
it to this vocabulary would make a fourth store for one fact.

THE VOCABULARY IS CLOSED and an unknown key is refused WITH the list. A setting that silently does
nothing is worse than an error, and an agent with no vocabulary invents one.

THE THREE DOORS (`app/main.py`). This module is pure; every one of its functions is reached through
exactly one route, and for one release NONE of the writers had one — the read door shipped alone,
so identity could only ever answer DEFAULTS and everybody who had turned their minutes off, or who
lives outside UTC, silently reverted on upgrade. That is the failure this file was written to end,
caused by the file being wired up halfway.

  * ``GET  /internal/users/{id}/settings`` → `read_person_facts` — what flows reads before it mails
    somebody or states a time. The five PERSON facts; `bot_name` is not among them.
  * ``PUT  /internal/users/{id}/settings`` → `apply` — the write half, partial and validated
    all-or-nothing. Body: any subset of ``timezone``, ``mail_minutes``, ``mail_join``,
    ``mail_rsvp``, ``mail_prep``. `bot_name` is REFUSED there (422): it is a fact about the bot,
    meetings owns it, and it already has a door.
  * ``POST /admin/users/{id}/settings/import`` → `plan_import` — the operator-driven one-shot
    migration. Body is the old ``.settings.json`` object verbatim, `bot_name` included; this is the
    one path that carries that key, into the bot's own store, and only when that store is empty.

Both internal doors require ``INTERNAL_API_SECRET`` with NO dev-mode bypass: the person is named in
the path by the caller, so an unauthenticated answer is a cross-user read of private preferences.
