"""``build_gateway()`` — construct the PRODUCTION gateway (`gateway.create_app`) wired to the
conformance fakes, so every O-API-1 assertion drives the SHIPPED app.

Before the carve this module was a hand-port of `services/api-gateway/main.py`. It is now a
**thin shim**: it imports `create_app` from the production `gateway` package and injects the
in-process fakes —

  * a port-fake DOWNSTREAM (meeting-api + transcription-collector) replaying the api.v1
    goldens (`fake_meeting_api.build_fake_downstream`), reached over an httpx ASGITransport;
  * an AUTHORIZER that resolves `x-api-key` by POSTing the fake admin-api's `/internal/validate`
    (same transport) — exactly `main._resolve_token`;
  * (the `/ws` multiplex uses the harness fakes — see `ws_harness.py`).

The single source of the proxy + auth + scope logic is now `gateway.app`; this file only
supplies the fakes that satisfy the gateway's ports. Allowed import direction: conformance
(test) → gateway (prod). The gateway package imports nothing from here.
