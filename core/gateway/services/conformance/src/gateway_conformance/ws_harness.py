"""The `/ws` multiplex conformance harness — fakes that satisfy the PRODUCTION gateway's
ports, driving `gateway.run_multiplex` (the SHIPPED control loop + fan-in).

Before the carve `WSMultiplexHarness.run` re-implemented `main.websocket_multiplex` by hand.
It is now a **thin driver**: `run()` calls the production `run_multiplex` (the public front-door
entry — no longer the private `gateway.app._run_multiplex`) against these fakes, so every ws.v1
assertion in `test_ws_protocol.py` exercises the shipped multiplex.

The fakes:
- `FakeWebSocket` — captures every `send_text` (so a test asserts the JSON frame the gateway
  emitted: subscribed / unsubscribed / pong / error) and serves a scripted queue of client
  messages. `receive_text` raises starlette's `WebSocketDisconnect` when the client hangs up —
  exactly the exception the production loop catches.
- `FakeRedis` / `FakePubSub` — an in-process publish→subscribe fan-in (`pubsub()` →
  subscribe/unsubscribe/listen). A payload PUBLISHed to a subscribed channel is forwarded
  VERBATIM to the socket, as the production `fan_in` does (forwards the raw redis payload).
- `CollectorAuthorizer` — the gateway's `Authorizer` port, whose `authorize_subscribe` hop now
  POSTs the REAL, SHIPPED (folded-in) collector's `/ws/authorize-subscribe`
  (`meeting_api.collector.create_app`) over an in-process ASGI transport, instead of a hand-rolled
  fake. The collector's production code decides authorization (DB-ownership boundary) and returns
  the `authorized` list (with `meeting_id` so the gateway knows which redis channels to fan in).
  `resolve` stays a stub (the `/ws` loop only needs a non-empty api_key). `FakeAuthorizer` is kept
  as a thin alias for backward-compatible construction from an
  `(platform, native_id) → {meeting_id, user_id}` map — it seeds the real collector's store from
  that map, so the same tests now drive shipped collector code.
