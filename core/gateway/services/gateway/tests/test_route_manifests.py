"""The edge assembles its route table from the domains it fronts, and owns none of it.

PRD decision 40.5 — *"the gateway still owns nothing: it composes, strips authority, re-stamps,
forwards"* — and 40.7, which makes that concrete: **agents are optional**, so a table that names
`/agent/*` unconditionally cannot describe a `no-agents` deployment (40.6: gateway + meetings +
flows + identity).

What these tests hold down, in the order they matter:

  1. the FULL profile is byte-for-byte what shipped — 67 scoped rows and 2 unscoped, and every one
     of them still matched to a route that exists;
  2. without the agent domain the table lacks EXACTLY its seven rows and nothing else;
  3. an absent domain's routes are absent from the APP too, so a request 404s rather than 403s;
  4. the refusals that make the assembly safe to compose from files.
