"""The per-route scope matrix, and the deny-by-default guard that keeps it complete.

Motivated by the rc.18 documented-API sweep against staging (finding B2): a key holding ONLY the
``browser`` scope returned 201 on ``POST /bots`` and scheduled a real bot container
(``mtg-26362-7c9e8908``), then stopped it with ``DELETE``. Same hole on ``GET /bots``,
``/bots/status``, ``/bots/{p}/{n}/chat``, ``/user/webhook`` and ``/user/calendar``, while
``/meetings``, ``/transcripts/*`` and ``/recordings`` refused it correctly — the mechanism existed
and those routes simply were not using it.

Two causes, one per family:
  * ``/bots`` was declared ``{"bot", "browser"}``, so ``browser`` alone satisfied it;
  * ``/user/*`` had no declaration at all, and an absent declaration meant "no check".

This module is the executable spec for both halves: a matrix of every protected route against every
single-scope key, and a guard proving a route with no declaration is denied rather than forwarded.
