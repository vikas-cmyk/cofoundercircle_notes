"""routes_manifest.py — the edge assembles its route table; it does not own one.

PRD decision 40.5: *"The gateway still owns nothing: it composes, strips authority, re-stamps,
forwards."* `ROUTE_SCOPES` was a 92-line literal in `app.py` holding all 69 rows — including the
agent domain's seven, which made the edge the place where a domain's route list was written down.
Decision 40.7 then makes that concretely wrong rather than merely untidy: **agents are optional**,
and a table that names `/agent/*` unconditionally cannot describe a deployment that has no agents.

So each domain declares its own routes beside its service, in a `routes.v1.json` — the same shape
as the `mcp.tools.v1` manifests and for the same reason: the domain that owns the door behind a
route is the only one that can say what the route is and what it costs.

    core/meetings/routes.v1.json                   38 rows
    core/identity/routes.v1.json                   12
    core/meetings/services/mcp/routes.v1.json      12
    core/agent/routes.v1.json                       7   ← absent in the no-agents profile
    core/gateway/services/gateway/routes.v1.json    2   the edge's OWN /health and /auth/me

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES, and why each is a boot failure rather than a log line — every one of them
is otherwise found by a person hitting a route that answers wrongly:

    a manifest that is not routes.v1        ->  a file shape nobody validated, silently ignored
    the same (method, path) twice           ->  two domains claiming one route; last-one-wins
    a scope name outside the vocabulary     ->  a typo'd scope is an empty set is a DENY-ALL
    a manifest for an absent domain         ->  the table describing a service that is not there

DENY-BY-DEFAULT SURVIVES THE MOVE. The assembled table is still exhaustive and still enforced as
such by `create_app`: a registered route that no manifest declares refuses to build. What changed
is only WHO writes the declaration down.

    the cut — and importing a package must not hard-require a file from a domain the product
    does not include. Module scope asserting all five were on disk is what made `import gateway`
    raise in the open-core cut and take every test module in the gateway conformance package
