"""gateway — the v0.12 PRODUCTION edge: auth · routing · WS fan-out.

The single source of the gateway lane's proxy + ``/ws`` multiplex logic (the v0.12 carve of
the deployed ``services/api-gateway/main.py``). Collaborators are injected as PORTS so the
SAME app runs with real adapters in prod and in-process fakes in the conformance harness.

Public surface (the front door):
  - ``create_app(authorizer, downstream, redis, ...)`` — the FastAPI gateway (REST proxy,
    fail-closed auth + deny-by-default scope 403, verbatim body passthrough; the ``/ws``
    multiplex; ``/health``). Raises if any route it registers declares no scope.
  - ``ROUTE_SCOPES`` / ``UNSCOPED_ROUTES`` / ``undeclared_routes(app)`` — the scope model and
    the executable form of the deny-by-default invariant.
  - ``CARRIED_DOMAINS`` — the domains this BUILD ships a route manifest for. The open-core build
    carries four of the five; an unspecified door in ``create_app`` defaults to these.
  - ``run_multiplex(ws, authorizer, redis)`` — the ``/ws`` control loop + fan-in, exposed so the
    conformance ws-harness drives the SHIPPED multiplex without reaching for a private.
  - ``ports`` — the Protocols: ``Authorizer``, ``DownstreamClient``, ``RedisBus`` (+ helpers).
  - ``adapters.build_production_app(...)`` — wire ``create_app`` with real httpx + redis.
  - ``obs`` — the lane's ``logevent.v1`` trace emitter (``TraceMiddleware``, ``log_event``).

Import direction is one-way: the conformance harness imports THIS package to drive the
shipped app; this package imports nothing from conformance.
