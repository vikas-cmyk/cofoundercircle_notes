"""Production adapters — the real implementations of the ``ports.py`` Protocols.

These are the wiring used when the gateway runs for real: an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` for the
admin-api token-validation hop, the meeting-api forward, and the ``/ws`` subscribe-authorization
hop; a ``redis.asyncio`` client for the ``/ws`` fan-in.

v0.12 P2 folded the transcription-collector INTO meeting-api (one modular monolith), so both the
proxy forward AND the ``/ws/authorize-subscribe`` hop target meeting-api — there is no longer a
separate collector URL.

They are deliberately thin — the carved behavior lives in ``app.py``; these only translate
the port calls to the concrete clients, exactly as ``services/api-gateway/main.py`` does
(``_resolve_token`` → admin-api ``/internal/validate``; the ``/ws/authorize-subscribe`` POST;
``client.request`` for the proxy; ``redis.pubsub()`` for fan-in). They carry NO test logic.

Importing this module requires ``httpx`` and ``redis`` (both pinned in ``pyproject.toml``);
the conformance harness never imports it — it injects its own in-process fakes.
