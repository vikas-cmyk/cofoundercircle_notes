/**
 * PyannoteSegmenter — streaming wrapper around
 * onnx-community/pyannote-segmentation-3.0.
 *
 * The model takes 10s of 16kHz mono audio per call and emits per-frame
 * (≈13ms) logits over a powerset of up to 3 local speakers:
 *
 *    0=∅, 1={1}, 2={2}, 3={3}, 4={1,2}, 5={1,3}, 6={2,3}
 *
 * For ONLINE boundary detection we keep a 10s ring buffer of recent audio
 * (regardless of utterance boundaries — pyannote benefits from context
 * across silences). Every `inferIntervalMs` we run inference on the
 * latest 10s and extract boundary events from the FRESHEST portion of
 * the per-frame predictions. A boundary fires when the speaker SET grows
 * (silence → {1}, {1} → {1,2} overlap-onset, {1} → {2} clean handoff).
 *
 * This module is a building block; the diarizer composes it with VAD
 * accumulation and wespeaker clustering. Architecture matches the
 * Coria 2021 / Diart pattern surfaced by the research workflow:
 *   - segmentation = per-frame multi-speaker (pyannote)
 *   - embedding    = utterance-level (wespeaker)
 *   - clustering   = online cosine-distance (our OnlineSpeakerClustering)
