/**
 * TurnSource — WHERE a turn's edges come from.
 *
 * The mixed lane receives ONE audio stream carrying the whole meeting, so until now it INFERRED
 * the turn structure from the waveform: pyannote-segmentation guesses where a speaker starts and
 * stops. That inference has a measured cost — on clean single-speaker audio the streaming
 * segmenter declared 131.5s of 270s as speech and 79 of an oracle's 251 words fell outside every
 * declared region, i.e. the guess DELETED speech (the gap-reclaim finding).
 *
 * But an RTP mixer already labels the mix it produces: every packet carries the CSRC list of the
 * sources that went into it, and the UA exposes those with a per-stream-stable id. That is a turn
 * edge OBSERVED rather than inferred, and it comes with something pyannote can never supply — a
 * stable identity per speaker for the life of the meeting.
 *
 * This file is the seam that lets both be the same thing to the transcriber:
 *
 *   PyannoteTurnSource — today's streaming segmenter, wrapped UNCHANGED. Every existing test
 *                        scores this path, and it stays the fallback lane forever.
 *   CsrcTurnSource     — the transport as the spine. A turn opens when a source becomes audible
 *                        and closes when it stops (plus hysteresis, because DTX and jitter make
 *                        a speaker's packet train intermittent). Turns carry `trackId`.
 *
 * THE OVERLAP RULE, and it is the load-bearing one. The audio is MIXED: when two sources are
 * audible at once their voices are in the same samples and no cut can separate them. A source
 * spine that simply merged the two into one turn would hand a confident single name to a span
 * containing two people — fabrication dressed as attribution. So concurrency opens a CONTESTED
 * turn instead: its own span, no trackId, published unattributed. It is visible in the stats and
 * measurable in a replay, which is the whole difference between a known limit and a silent lie.
