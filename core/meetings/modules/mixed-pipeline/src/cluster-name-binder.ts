/**
 * ClusterNameBinder — converges two unreliable signals into speaker names:
 *
 *   1. The DIARIZER says WHEN the speaker changed (turn boundaries + stable
 *      per-session cluster ids). Cluster ids are PROVISIONAL — stable but
 *      meaningless ("speaker_0", "speaker_1", …).
 *   2. The platform UI says WHO is speaking around some wall-clock time, via
 *      one or more HINT streams, each with its own latency and failure modes:
 *        - 'dom-active'  : Zoom active-speaker DOM poll   (~250 ms lag, null
 *                          gaps between speakers, selector rot)
 *        - 'caption'     : Teams caption events           (~500–1500 ms lag,
 *                          flicker, absent when captions are off)
 *        - 'dom-outline' : Teams voice-outline transitions (~200 ms lag,
 *                          flicker, vanishes when video tiles change)
 *
 * Resolution per diarizer commit (generalized verbatim from the pack's
 * TeamsAttributor — pack-msteams-diarization-cutover #394):
 *
 *   a. WINDOW MATCH: find hint turns whose lag-shifted [tStart, tEnd] overlap
 *      the commit's [tStart, tEnd]; the name with the most overlap-ms wins.
 *   b. CLUSTER VOTE: no overlap → majority of names previously resolved for
 *      this cluster id (a cluster keeps its identity through hint gaps).
 *   c. PROVISIONAL: neither → publish the cluster id itself; when a later
 *      commit resolves the cluster, `onLateResolve` fires so the caller runs
 *      speakerManager.updateSpeakerName(clusterId, realName) and the already-
 *      published segments self-correct (stable segment_id + collector UPSERT).
 *
 * Hint turn model: a hint event marks the START of that name's turn; the turn
 * ends at the next hint of the same kind (any name), at an explicit end event
 * (`isEnd`), or after MAX_TURN_MS. This is exactly the caption-log model from
 * the pack, applied uniformly to every hint kind.
