/**
 * CSRC observation — what the RTP transport says about who is audible in the mix.
 *
 * CLEAN-ROOM NOTE: implemented from the WebRTC specification alone —
 * `RTCRtpReceiver.getContributingSources()` returning `RTCRtpContributingSource`
 * (W3C webrtc-pc, and its MDN reference pages). No other implementation of this idea was
 * opened, fetched or consulted while writing it.
 *
 * WHY. The mixed lane receives ONE audio stream carrying the whole meeting, so nothing in the
 * waveform says who is speaking; today that is inferred twice (a segmenter guesses turn
 * boundaries, a binder guesses a name per turn from flickery DOM hints). But the transport
 * already carries the answer: an RTP mixer stamps each packet of the mix with the CSRC list of
 * the sources it mixed, and the UA exposes the recent ones — each with a per-stream-stable
 * numeric id, the time its most recent contribution arrived, and its audio level.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. This brick is a SENSOR. It observes and emits transitions; it decides
 * nothing, names nobody, and reaches no pipeline. Whether the transport becomes the turn spine is
 * a later decision, made on the evidence this produces.
 *
 * Deliberate properties, each against the obvious alternative:
 *   • **Transitions only.** A 100 ms poll over a steady speaker would otherwise emit ten
 *     identical records a second for an hour; the tape would be enormous and say nothing a pair
 *     of edges doesn't. Steady state emits NOTHING.
 *   • **Synthetic deactivation, not "absent from the poll".** The UA keeps listing a source for
 *     seconds after it stops (webrtc-pc: sources contributing "recently"), so presence in the
 *     latest poll is not liveness — the entry's own timestamp is. A source is active while it was
 *     seen within `inactiveMs`, and its deactivation is SYNTHESIZED when that lapses. A sensor
 *     that only reported what the UA listed would report everyone as speaking forever.
 *   • **Never throws into capture.** The whole poll body is wrapped, a receiver whose
 *     `getContributingSources` throws is counted and SKIPPED while the others keep working, and
 *     the first error emits one typed observation (one, not one per 100 ms — a broken receiver
 *     would otherwise bury the pod's logs at 10 lines/second).
 *   • **Platform-agnostic.** No platform vocabulary anywhere in this file: RTP mixing is a
 *     transport fact, identical on every client that mixes server-side.
 *
 * The page→Node record this feeds (`<session>.csrc.jsonl`, one JSON object per line) is:
 *   {"type":"csrc","t":1754899200123,"csrc":3735928559,"active":true,
 *    "audioLevel":0.42,"rtpTimestamp":123456789,"lane":"mixed"}
 * `t` is epoch ms — the SAME clock the audio frames and the naming hints carry, which is the only
 * reason a stored tape can line CSRC edges up against audio at all.
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *  - the bot: bundled into browser-utils.global.js; the capture bridge starts it in the mixed lane.
 *  - anything else that already installed the remote-audio hook (the extension) — it reuses that
 *    hook's peer-connection registry rather than patching RTCPeerConnection a second time.
