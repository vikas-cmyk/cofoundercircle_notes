/**
 * gmeet-capture-v1 — the Google Meet capture.v1 PRODUCER (browser context).
 *
 * Composes the two raw-signal bricks of this module into ONE capture.v1 stream:
 *   - gmeet-capture   → per-participant PCM chunks (onAudio(index, pcm))
 *   - gmeet-speakers  → the live glow (litNames(): who is lit RIGHT NOW)
 *
 * and STAMPS each audio chunk with the glow name lit at that chunk's capture time.
 * This binds identity to AUDIO at the source — the inversion the gmeet rethink
 * needs: Meet's remote channels are an anonymous rotating pool (channel ≠ speaker),
 * but the glow names the live speaker, so the only reliable key is the lit name,
 * not the channel index. Binding here (audio, not a transcript segment) keeps SoC
 * clean and means the downstream gmeet pipeline transcribes PER-NAME with no
 * diarizer and no post-hoc window-match.
 *
 * Pure browser code — no node/Playwright. Used by BOTH services: the bot wires
 * `sink` to its in-process CaptureV1Sink; the extension wires `sink` to the WS
 * codec (encodeAudioFrame now carries speakerName). Same module, two services.
