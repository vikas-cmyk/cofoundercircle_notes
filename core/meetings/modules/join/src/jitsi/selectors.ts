// Jitsi Meet (web client) selectors — the JOIN layer's read surface
// (join / admission / leave / removal). Speaker-tile and capture selectors are
// recording concerns and stay OUTSIDE this brick.
//
// Jitsi Meet is self-hostable, so the DOM can vary by deployment version.
// Every lookup below therefore carries fallbacks ordered newest-UI-first, and
// the admission oracle prefers the `window.APP.conference` runtime API (stable
// across versions, part of the jitsi-meet web app) over DOM heuristics.
//
// TEXT-SELECTOR SEMANTICS (Playwright): quoted `text="foo"` is EXACT match
// (case-sensitive); unquoted `text=foo` is SUBSTRING (case-insensitive).
// `*Texts` exports are raw strings scanned inside page.evaluate() — not
// Playwright selectors. src/shared/selector-validity.test.ts gates the
// `*Selectors` / `*Indicators` arrays.

// ---- Pre-join page ----

// Display-name input on the prejoin screen. `#premeeting-name-input` is the
// stable id in current jitsi-meet; the class + placeholder forms cover older
// deployments.
export const jitsiNameInputSelector =

// The prejoin "Join meeting" button. `data-testid` is current jitsi-meet;
// the class form covers older builds.

// ---- Auth landing (deployment-specific pre-gate) ----
// Some self-hosted deployments front the app with a sign-in landing ("Sign in to Jitsi" +
// an SSO button + a guest option). A recorder bot enters as a guest; these raw phrases are
// matched (case-insensitive) against button/link text inside page.evaluate — not Playwright
// selectors.
export const jitsiGuestEntryTexts = [
  "continue as guest",

// type/placeholder matches cover the dialog across versions.

// The hangup (leave) control only renders inside the conference — the primary
// DOM positive. aria-label falls back for builds without the class.

// ---- Lobby (knocking) / waiting indicators ----
// With lobby enabled, the app shows a "knocking" screen after the join click
// until a moderator admits or declines. Members-only rooms show a
// waiting-for-host dialog instead.
// Structural indicators only — the lobby PHRASES live in jitsiLobbyTexts (one owner;
// the body-text scan covers every phrase, so duplicating them as text= selectors
// would only add dead per-poll lookups).

// Lobby decline, kick, and termination all surface as dialog/notification text.
export const jitsiRejectionTexts = [
  'Your request to join has been declined',
  'request to join has been rejected',
  'declined by a moderator',

// NB: no "disconnected" phrasing here — jitsi shows a "You have been disconnected"
// overlay during TRANSIENT reconnects it recovers from on its own; treating it as
// terminal would tear the bot out of a meeting that resumes seconds later. The
// isJoined() debounce owns connection-loss detection.
export const jitsiRemovalTexts = [
  'kicked out of the meeting',
  'You have been kicked',
  'meeting has been terminated',

// ---- Post-meeting / rejoin page indicators ----
// After a leave/kick jitsi lands on a feedback / "Rejoin" page (or the
// deployment's close page).
