/**
 * Typed admission outcome shared by every platform admission wait (google_meet, jitsi, …).
 *
 * denial               — a moderator/host explicitly rejected the bot from the lobby/waiting room.
 * lobby_timeout        — the bot stayed in the lobby/waiting state past the admission timeout.
 * join_failure         — the bot never reached the lobby / no admission signal ever appeared.
 * auth_session_missing — authenticated mode found a signed-out browser profile (the guest lobby
 *                        rendered); the profile is dead, so a re-spawn can never succeed.
 *
 * The JoinDriver maps this `outcome` onto a completion reason, so a lobby timeout is reported
 * as `awaiting_admission_timeout` (retry-honest) rather than a generic `join_failure`. Lives in
 * `shared/` so each platform throws the SAME class the driver checks with `instanceof`, without
 * coupling one platform sibling to another.
