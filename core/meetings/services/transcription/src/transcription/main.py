# Bound on the ENTIRE per-request transcription work - all temperature-fallback attempts
# together (see the for-loop below), not each attempt individually. The semaphore permit for a
# request is only released in the handler's `finally`, which only runs once this awaited work
# returns - so work that never returns (pathological input, a hang inside
# CTranslate2/faster-whisper, thread contention under load) would hold its permit forever
# regardless of how small MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSCRIPTIONS is. This is a backstop independent of the
# concurrency default above.
#
# What this DOES guarantee: the semaphore permit is always reclaimed within TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT_S.
# What it does NOT guarantee: asyncio.wait_for only cancels the await - concurrent.futures.Future
# .cancel() is a no-op once a thread has started, so the underlying thread keeps running the real
# call to completion (or forever) and keeps occupying its transcription_executor slot. A reclaimed
# permit is only useful because that executor is sized with headroom over MAX_CONCURRENT_TRANSCRIPTIONS
# (see below) - without that headroom the next admitted request just queues behind the zombie
# thread and reclaiming the permit buys nothing. A genuinely hung native call still burns one
# thread and its CPU core for good; actually killing it would need subprocess isolation, which is
# deliberately out of scope here - this is a mitigation, not a hard kill switch.
#
# This is a HANG BACKSTOP, not a latency governor. Its only job is to guarantee the semaphore
# permit above is eventually reclaimed when model.transcribe() itself never returns; it is not
# meant to bound how long a legitimate transcription is allowed to run, and should fire rarely or
# never in normal operation. Do NOT align it under the bot's own 30s per-attempt
# AbortController (core/meetings/modules/whisper/src/transcription-client.ts:241-242): a bound
# below real worst-case work turns every full-size chunk into a guaranteed 504, which is a worse
# outage than the hang this backstop exists to catch. The client abandoning an attempt at 30s and
# the server going on to burn time on it anyway is accepted waste - the alternative (this timeout
# cutting off a transcription that was legitimately about to finish correctly) is worse.
#
# Measured 2026-08-13 on the reference CPU deployment this default is sized for (12-core NAS,
# DEVICE=cpu, COMPUTE_TYPE=int8, MODEL_SIZE=large-v3-turbo, MAX_ACTIVE_REQUESTS=2,
# CPU_THREADS=6, single request, zero contention): a ~30s audio chunk - the gmeet lane's
# maxBufferDuration hard cap, i.e. the largest chunk this service is ever handed - took 28.5-29.0s
# of wall clock per attempt (two runs: total=29.047187s http=200 and total=28.509628s http=200;
# faster-whisper's own log for the second run: "completed in 28.51s - Duration: 29.95s"). That is
# ~0.95x realtime: this CPU/model combination cannot keep pace with a live meeting no matter how
# concurrency is tuned, and a single legitimate attempt already sits close to 29s - a 25s bound
# would 504 every full-size chunk on exactly the deployment this fix targets. 120s leaves ~4x
# margin over that measured per-attempt time. Do not re-tighten this from guesswork; re-measure on
# the target hardware first. Note this bound covers the WHOLE request, not one attempt - with
# USE_TEMPERATURE_FALLBACK enabled, up to 6 attempts share this one budget, not 120s each; raise
