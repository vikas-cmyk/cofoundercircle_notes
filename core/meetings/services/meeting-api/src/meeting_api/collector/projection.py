"""List-view shaping for the meetings list (#584).

The meetings-list endpoints (``GET /bots``, ``GET /meetings``) return a row PER meeting. Each row used
to embed that meeting's full ``data`` JSONB — transcripts, speaker events, logs, recordings, and
calendar event snapshots. Those details can make a single page multi-megabyte even though no list
consumer renders them.

We cannot drop ``data`` from the list wholesale — the list genuinely renders a few LIGHT keys from it
(a meeting's ``title``, connected ``docs``, ``scheduled_at``, the recording/transcribe flags). So the
list keeps those light keys and drops only the heavy detail keys — the ones that made the response
multi-MB and that the list never renders. The detail path (``GET /meetings/{id}`` and the transcript
endpoints) still ships the rest of ``data``.

Size is not the only reason a key stays off a response. ``meeting.data`` is a shared row blob that
also carries operational state — webhook signing config, share grants, session paths — which is not
meeting content and which the read's access rule (owner OR transcript-share recipient OR bound-
workspace member) would otherwise hand to a second party.

That state is not one bucket, and treating it as one is what #1243 got wrong. It splits in two by
WHO may see it, so the response projection is VIEWER-AWARE:

* :data:`SENSITIVE_OMIT_KEYS` — credential material and other people's material. Off every edge for
  every viewer, the OWNER INCLUDED: the signing secret, the per-link share grants, the S3 session
  path. The owner has dedicated endpoints for all three and no meeting response needs to carry them.
* :data:`OWNER_ONLY_KEYS` — owner-private but not credentials: the webhook endpoint + event filter
  and the reader roster. The owner's own configuration on the owner's own meeting, which the v0.10
  REST contract promises them (``compat/v010_rest_compat_test.py::test_10_user_webhook_config_flow``
  reads ``data.webhook_url`` back from ``GET /meetings``). Stripped for anyone who is not the owner —
  a transcript-share recipient receives the transcript, not the owner's endpoint configuration, and
  must not be able to enumerate who else the meeting was shared with.

Ownership is not re-derived here. Every caller already computed it — ``list_meetings`` builds its
access union and stamps ``shared``, ``get_transcript_by_id`` evaluates an explicit owner branch,
``update_planned_meeting`` is owner-scoped in SQL — so the decision is PASSED DOWN as
``viewer_is_owner``. It defaults to ``False``, so a caller that forgets to thread it gets the STRICT
view; the failure direction is a missing field, never a disclosure.

This module holds what the real store (``adapters.py``), the router (``app.py``) and the in-memory
fake (``fakes.py``) must share so they can never diverge: the heavy keys dropped from a list row, the
two tiers of response omissions, and the default page size that bounds an otherwise-unbounded list.
