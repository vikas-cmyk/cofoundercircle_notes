"""Segment ingestion — the deterministic unit behind the collector's redis-stream worker.

The deployed collector runs a background loop (``collector/consumer.py`` XREADGROUP →
``collector/processors.py``) that drains the ``transcription_segments`` stream, persists each
segment, and (with the bot's live path) publishes change-only updates to
``tc:meeting:{id}:mutable`` (``services/redis.md`` — the pubsub the gateway ``/ws`` fans in).

This carve splits that into a pure, explicitly-driven core:

  * ``ingest(store, redis, message)`` — process ONE stream message: parse the JSON ``payload``,
    append each valid segment to the store, publish one ``:mutable`` update per meeting. Returns
    the number of segments persisted.
  * ``consume_segments(store, redis, ...)`` — drain a batch from the bus (``read_segments`` →
    ``ingest`` each → ``ack``). No background loop: the eval calls this explicitly, like the
    runtime scheduler's ``tick()`` — same in ⇒ same out.

The ``:mutable`` payload mirrors the bot's live publisher
(``services/vexa-bot_new/src/adapters/transcript-redis.ts``):
``{type:"transcript", meeting:{id}, speaker, confirmed, pending, ts}``.
