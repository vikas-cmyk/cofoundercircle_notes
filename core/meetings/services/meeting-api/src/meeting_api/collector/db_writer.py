"""The background **db-writer** — flush live Redis segments (and processed notes) to the durable store.

RESTORES the parent loop the 0.12 carve dropped (0.10 ``meeting_api/collector/db_writer.py``
``process_redis_to_postgres``): the consumer (``ingest.py``) lands live segments in the Redis hash
``meeting:{id}:segments`` and the read path merges Postgres + that hash — but WITHOUT this writer
nothing ever moved segments INTO Postgres, so the ``transcriptions`` table stayed empty and a redis
eviction/restart lost the meeting's transcript forever (the release-blocking data-loss defect).

Parent semantics, kept exactly:

  * **cadence** — one tick per ``DB_WRITER_INTERVAL_S`` (parent ``BACKGROUND_TASK_INTERVAL``, 10s);
    the tick is a single explicit function (``db_writer_tick``) the eval drives directly, wrapped in
    the ``while True: tick; sleep`` poll by ``__main__`` like its three loop siblings.
  * **mutable-last-segment** — only segments whose ``updated_at`` is older than
    ``IMMUTABILITY_THRESHOLD`` (30s) are flushed; the still-mutable tail (drafts being refined)
    stays in Redis until it settles. A later rewrite of an already-flushed segment re-enters the
    hash and is flushed again — the sink upserts on ``(meeting_id, segment_id)`` so it lands as an
    UPDATE, never a duplicate.
  * **trim policy** — flushed (and empty-text) hash fields are HDEL'd **only after** the sink
    confirms the durable write; a failed write leaves the hash intact for the next tick. When a
    hash drains empty its meeting id leaves the ``active_meetings`` set.
  * **discovery** — the ``active_meetings`` set (maintained ATOMICALLY with every hash write by
    ``append_segment`` — one transactional sadd+hset+expire) is authoritative in steady state, so a
    tick sweeps the SET alone. The self-healing ``meeting:*:segments`` key scan — for a hash written
    before the set existed (mid-upgrade) or a set/hash divergence — runs ONLY on a ``reconcile`` tick
    (startup + every ``DB_WRITER_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_S``), never per tick: the O(keyspace) scan on the
    10s hot path saturated Redis and starved the /health probe, restarting healthy pods (#893).

Additions over the parent:

  * ``finalize_meeting(...)`` — the completion hook: flush EVERYTHING left (threshold 0, mutable
    tail included) the moment the lifecycle FSM lands on a terminal status, so a completed meeting's
    transcript is durable immediately instead of eventually.
  * ``flush_meeting_processed(...)`` — drain the copilot's cleaned-notes stream
    (``proc:meeting:{meeting_id}``, agent-worker the single writer, P23) into the meeting row's
    ``data['processed']`` JSONB (the documented meeting.data home; NO schema change), resuming
    from the persisted ``source_cursor``. Redis was the ONLY home of the processed doc before
    this — stopping the bot made the processed output unreachable over REST.

RESTORED ON THIS RELEASE, AND WHY — read this before deleting it again. The drain was removed once
with the justification "PRD decision 34 removed the producer: nothing writes that stream". On this
candidate that sentence is FALSE, and it is checkable in three places, all of which
``tests/test_db_writer.py::test_the_processed_notes_producer_is_still_here`` asserts from source:

  * ``core/agent/control_plane/dispatch.py`` still stamps ``VEXA_TRANSCRIPT_STREAM`` on a meeting
    dispatch, so the meeting worker still runs;
  * ``core/agent/worker/engine.py`` still passes ``proc_stream=f"proc:meeting:{row_id}"`` into
    ``serve_meeting`` — unconditionally, on that path;
  * ``core/agent/worker/meeting.py`` still ``xadd``s each cleaned note onto it, and still emits the
    ``view_end`` marker.

The removal commit that made the claim true (``f95d4d5e0``) is NOT in this branch's ancestry; the
docstring travelled here without the code it described. With the producer alive and the drain gone,
``proc:meeting:{id}`` fills up in redis and ``data.processed.views[]`` is never written — so the
terminal's durable notes pane and the schedule digest's ``notes`` flag are permanently empty the
moment the bot stops. That is the exact bug the drain was written for. **If the producer is ever
actually removed, delete the producer and this drain in ONE change** — the failure mode being
avoided here is a half-applied removal, in either direction.

The persisted processed shape is ADDRESSABLE and VERSIONED (multi-consumer, per the release DoD):
``data.processed = {"views": [{id, kind, params, doc, source_cursor, updated_at}]}`` — ``params``
records the processing metadata APPLIED (provider/model/pipeline, stamped by the producing worker
on the stream entries — reproducibility), ``doc`` is the view body (``{"notes": [...]}`` for the
copilot's cleaned-transcript view), ``source_cursor`` the stream position the view reflects. A
LIST of views so multiple processings of one meeting (per-workspace views are coming) coexist;
today the collector maintains the ONE meeting-scoped copilot view, upserted by ``id``. The views
ride the sealed api.v1 responses' existing free-form ``data`` field (GET /transcripts +
GET /meetings) — no new REST surface, no contract change.

Everything here talks to redis through plain client calls (hgetall/hdel/smembers/scan/xrange) that
both ``redis.asyncio`` and ``fakeredis.aioredis`` satisfy, and to the durable store through two
getattr-guarded sink methods (``upsert_segments``, ``merge_processed_notes``) implemented by BOTH
``SqlAlchemyTranscriptStore`` (prod) and ``InMemoryTranscriptStore`` (tests) — so the whole writer
is unit-tested offline, no docker.

# WHAT THE 30 s IS FOR. A lane that REFINES A ROW IN PLACE — the gmeet lane — can publish a draft,
# then republish the confirmed text under a DIFFERENT segment id (``speaker-streams.ts`` rotates
# ``windowStartMs`` at :350/:364/:739) and withdraw the old draft by emitting EMPTY TEXT under the
# old id. Empty text is never stored and never deletes an already-flushed row, so a draft that
# reached postgres before its id rotated is orphaned there for good. The hold is what keeps those
# drafts from ever becoming durable: they are superseded inside the window and dropped from the
# hash. That guarantee is real and is NOT touched here.
#
# WHY THE TEAMS CSRC LANE DOES NOT NEED IT. Its drafts use disjoint ids and are actively
# RETRACTED — ``transcript_retract`` → ``delete_segments`` deletes the durable row as well as the
# hash field. A confirmed row is never withdrawn by empty text. The lane is identified without
# widening the legacy Zoom/Jitsi blast radius: ``source: 'merged'`` plus the stable
# ``speaker_key: 'csrc:<id>'`` emitted only by the Teams adapter. For a confirmed Teams row the
# hold buys nothing and costs the customer the whole 30 s: measured on prod
# meeting 26088, time-to-durable was 39.4 s median of which 36.2 s is this threshold plus the
# writer's poll phase, against 2.0 s for the model to produce the text.
