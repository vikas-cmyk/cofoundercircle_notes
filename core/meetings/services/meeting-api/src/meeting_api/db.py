"""Shared async-engine construction for meeting-api (#635).

meeting-api opens a Postgres pool at FOUR sites — the unified boot (``__main__.py``) and the three
standalone module runners (``bot_spawn``/``collector``/``recordings`` ``build_production_*``). This
module is the single seam that reads the pool env (``DB_POOL_SIZE`` / ``DB_MAX_OVERFLOW``) and applies
it, so every composition honors the same per-pod pool ceiling ``deploy/db-budget.json`` audits — the
knob is no longer wired in one path and silently defaulted in the others.

``pool_pre_ping=True`` is preserved (it was on every site before #635). Defaults 5/10 match
``deploy/db-budget.json``. Imported lazily by the boot paths so merely importing a service module
never pulls SQLAlchemy into the offline gate venv.
