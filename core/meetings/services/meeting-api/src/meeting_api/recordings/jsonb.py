"""recording.v1 JSONB record materialization — the ``meeting.data['recordings'][]`` writer.

Ported from the parent ``recording_jsonb.py``: fold one uploaded chunk into the recording's JSONB
payload — per-type ``media_files`` cumulative tracking, late-chunk-master-preserve (Pack U.7), and
sticky COMPLETED status. PURE dict logic, NO IO/DB: the route keeps the storage upload + the row
lock + commit; this owns only the record shape (recordings live in ``meetings.data`` JSONB — there

# A tape is NOT a recording. It is an internal fixture — the raw captured-signal.v1 stream a bot
# teed for offline replay — and it deliberately does NOT fold into ``meeting.data['recordings']``:
# folding would make a "recording" appear in ``GET /recordings`` for every meeting the user never
# asked to record, carrying a media_files entry no player can open.
#
# Its keyspace is TOP-LEVEL ``signal/`` rather than a ``signal/`` folder nested inside a recording's
# prefix. That is the janitor's constraint, not an aesthetic one: the budget sweep lists every tape
# in the bucket on a timer, and a nested layout would force it to page through every recording chunk
# object in the deployment to find them. A top-level prefix keeps the sweep O(tapes).

# log). A CLOSED set — the part name lands in an object key, so it is never caller-shaped (the
# session_uid in the key is already constrained by find_session).
#
# `stt`, `captions`, `csrc` and `observations` are SIDECARS rather than record types inside the

# captured-signal.v1 is sealed at three records (SessionHeader · CapturedFrame · HintEvent): a
# fourth would make every stored session fail its own contract, and the replay loader validates
# line by line, so the tape would stop replaying the moment a Teams meeting produced a caption.
# Adding a caption or transition record to the contract is a v2 decision, not a side effect of
# wiring a lane.
#
# `botlog` and `transcript` are the two parts that are not signal at all. The first is what the bot
# SAID about its own run — the commentary a human debugs from, which until now lived only in a pod
# deleted minutes later, so every "why did it do that?" began by asking for a log nobody still had.
# It is also the ONLY part that may arrive TRUNCATED (with the drop named inside it) rather than
# skipped: nothing folds a log, a human reads it. The second is the transcript a viewer was
# actually left with after every retraction — a fold over the publish stream that every consumer
# performs and nobody stored, so "what did this meeting say?" could only be answered by re-running
