"""Ports (Protocols) for the recordings flow — chunk upload + finalize → master in
``meeting.data`` JSONB.

The parent ``recordings.internal_upload_recording`` + ``recording_finalizer`` talk to two
collaborators:

  * **object storage (MinIO/S3)** — each chunk is uploaded under a per-(recording, session, type)
    key; finalize concatenates the chunks into a master and uploads that. Expressed as a ``Storage``
    Protocol: ``upload(key, data, content_type)``, ``list(prefix)``, ``get(key)``.
  * **the meeting store** — resolve the ``MeetingSession`` by ``session_uid`` (the upload arrives
    with the bot's ``connectionId``), and read/modify-under-lock ``meeting.data['recordings']``.
    Expressed as a ``RecordingRepo`` Protocol.

Each is a ``typing.Protocol`` so the app depends on BEHAVIOR, not a concrete client. ``adapters.py``
supplies the production implementations (MinIO + SQLAlchemy); the module's tests supply in-process
fakes (an in-memory blob store + an in-memory meeting store).
