"""The recordings flow — chunk upload + finalize → master in ``meeting.data`` JSONB.

Port of the parent ``recordings.internal_upload_recording`` + ``recording_finalizer`` CORE:

  * ``upload_chunk(...)`` — verify the MeetingToken, resolve the bot's ``MeetingSession`` by
    ``session_uid``, upload the chunk to object storage, fold it into the recording's JSONB payload
    (``jsonb.apply_chunk_to_recording``) under a read-modify-write on ``meeting.data['recordings']``,
    and return the upload receipt.
  * ``finalize_master(...)`` — concatenate a recording media-file's chunks into a master via the
    golden-locked ``build_recording_master`` codec, upload the master, and stamp the JSONB media-file
    (``storage_path`` → master key, ``finalized_by``, ``is_final``, ``playback_url``).

The codec itself (``meeting_api.build_recording_master``, recording.v1) is already ported +
golden-locked — this module only orchestrates the IO + the JSONB bookkeeping around it.
