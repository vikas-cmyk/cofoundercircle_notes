"""The Redis-backed reliable retry queue + the crash-safe worker sweep.

Derived from the parent's `webhook_retry_worker.py`, reimplemented clean. Failed deliveries are
persisted to a Redis list (`webhook:retry_queue`); each entry carries its own `next_retry_at` +
`attempt`, and the exponential `BACKOFF_SCHEDULE`. `drain_retry_queue` is ONE worker tick (the
parent's `_process_queue` loop body) — the eval calls it directly instead of running the background
poll loop, so the test is deterministic (no sleeps).

Crash-safety (issue #520). The old drain LPOPped every entry into a process-local `requeue` list
and RPUSHed it back only at the END of the sweep, so a worker crash mid-sweep lost every popped
entry — the recovery mechanism itself dropped envelopes. This drain uses the classic Redis
**reliable-queue** pattern: each entry is atomically moved from the queue into a **processing list**
with ``RPOPLPUSH`` (never held only in process memory), delivered, then removed from the processing
list on ack / re-queued with a bumped attempt+next_retry_at on reschedule / moved to the
dead-letter list on exhaustion. A crash leaves the in-flight entry in the processing list; the next
tick's reclaim pass moves any processing entry older than a **lease** back to the queue, where it is
re-delivered. Re-delivery is at-least-once and safe to dedupe: #519 made ``event_id`` deterministic,
so a receiver dedupes a lease-reclaim redelivery on its stored ``event_id``.

Scope (stated plainly): this closes the crash-mid-sweep loss. It does NOT make the ledger survive a
full Redis restart / storage outage — the ledger is still in Redis, which the hosted platform runs
memory-only. Restart/outage durability requires persistent managed Redis (an owner/infra decision);
see the PR's follow-up note.

The redis client is async (`redis.asyncio` / `fakeredis.aioredis`). The transport is injected, same
as `WebhookSink`, so the worker drains against the fake receiver too.
