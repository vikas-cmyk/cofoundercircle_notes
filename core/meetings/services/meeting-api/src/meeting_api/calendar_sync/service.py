"""Pure calendar-sync logic — ICS text → PlannedEvents → planned-meeting upserts.

Offline-testable: ``parse_ics`` is a pure function over the feed text + a clock; ``sync_user``
drives the injected TranscriptStore's planned-meeting primitives (the SAME ones POST /meetings
uses, so every insert takes the per-user advisory lock and respects the unique partial index).

The load-bearing rule: **one row per calendar UID — the NEXT upcoming occurrence only.** A weekly
meeting reuses the same Meet link every occurrence; two scheduled rows on one native id would
violate the active-row unique index. Importing only the next occurrence sidesteps that entirely
(the following occurrence imports on a later sweep, after the current one completes).

Import rule (fail loud, design-spec meeting-lifecycle-v2 §v4 BUG-2): EVERY upcoming event
imports. Events with a RECOGNIZABLE meeting link (Meet/Zoom/Teams via ``collector.meeting_link``)
import armed; events WITHOUT one import as LINK-LESS planned rows (``platform='unknown'``,
no native id) so the terminal can render the honest "bot not armed — no link" state instead of
the event silently vanishing. A link appearing in a later feed sweep arms the existing row.
``STATUS:CANCELLED`` events and UIDs that vanish from the feed cancel their still-planned row;
a row the bot FSM owns (live/completed) is NEVER touched by sync.

Adoption by link is by (platform, native) over EVERY non-terminal row, intent AND live. An
imported event whose meeting is already running attaches its calendar identity to that live row
(``_attach_live_source`` — uid/sources only, never ``auto_join``/``scheduled_at``/status) rather
than importing a sibling: a sibling is what the auto-join sweep sends a SECOND bot for.

TERMINAL rows are past and are never matched or adopted — but they are not weightless, and WHICH
terminal a row reached decides opposite things about whether its occurrence still wants a bot. That
decision is not made here: ``lifecycle.occurrence.disposition`` owns the whole table (USER_STOPPED /
SERVED / RETRY over every status × completion_reason the codebase can emit), and this module asks it.

A **RETRY** occurrence is unserved — the bot never reached the room. When the auto-join sweep
dispatched for one (``data.auto_join_last_attempt``) and its bot then failed to join, the row goes
terminal, leaves this module's index, and the very next sweep of the same feed finds an unmatched UID
and creates a sibling that is due on sight — a fresh bot every sync interval until the grace window
closes (live 2026-08-17, user 13820). So the replacement row CARRIES that spent attempt forward
(``_spent_attempt``), scoped to the OCCURRENCE and not the UID: a weekly meeting whose bot failed
today still sends one tomorrow.

A **SERVED** or **USER_STOPPED** occurrence is finished, and recreating it hands the sweep a row to
send a second bot on. That is exactly what happened on stage rev 192: meeting 26312 was deliberately
stopped at 22:28:31, sync recreated the occurrence as 26313 at 22:28:46, and the sweep — its 300s
backoff since 22:21:01 legitimately elapsed — dispatched a fresh bot at 22:28:47, into the founder's
meeting, uninvited. So a finished occurrence is NOT recreated (``_finished_row``): it is already in
the user's list as the terminal meeting that carries its transcript, which is a truer record than an
empty planned sibling, and no row means nothing for the sweep to arm. Occurrence-scoped like the
backoff (``OCCURRENCE_MATCH_S``), so next week's instance imports armed.
