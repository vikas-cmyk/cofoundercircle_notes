The terminal's "Connect your calendar" panel needs IMMEDIATE feedback (paste → result), so the
same pass the background loop runs every ``CALENDAR_SYNC_INTERVAL_S`` is also callable on demand
for a single user. Both callers get the identical stamp shape that lands in redis
``cal:sync:{user_id}``: ``{last_sync, last_error, counts?}`` — the panel renders it as-is.
