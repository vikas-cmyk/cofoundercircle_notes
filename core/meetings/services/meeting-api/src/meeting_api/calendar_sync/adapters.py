"""Production I/O for calendar sync — the ICS fetch (SSRF-pinned) + the config discovery hop.

``fetch_ics`` dereferences a USER-SUPPLIED URL server-side, so it MUST ride the same pinned
transport the webhook sender uses (``webhooks/ssrf.build_pinned_transport``): the host is
resolved + validated at connect time and the socket dials the validated IP — a DNS-rebinding
flip can never turn the poller into an internal-network probe. Size-capped: a feed larger than
``MAX_ICS_BYTES`` is refused, not parsed.

``fetch_configs`` asks admin-api's internal edge (X-Internal-Secret) which users have a feed
connected — the secret URL crosses only this internal hop.
