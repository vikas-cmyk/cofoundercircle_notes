# calendar_sync — ICS feed → planned meetings

One concern: turn a user's secret ICS calendar feed into PLANNED meeting rows (intent status
`scheduled`, complete `data.calendar_sources[].event` provenance) so the Meetings surface shows what's coming and the
auto-join sweep sends the bot when each meeting starts. No OAuth — the user pastes the
secret-address ICS URL Google Calendar / Outlook already provide (`PUT /user/calendar`, identity
domain).

## Public surface
- `parse_ics(text, now, horizon_days=14)` → `{"events": [PlannedEvent], "cancelled_uids": […]}`
  (pure). **One event per UID — the next upcoming occurrence only** (a recurring meeting reuses one
  link; two active rows on one native id would violate `uq_meeting_active_user_platform_native`).
  Every event carries a JSON-safe snapshot of all VEVENT properties, parameters, nested components,
  top-level VCALENDAR properties, and the series master for an override. Link-less events still
  import honestly; only recognized Meet/Zoom/Teams links arm auto-join.
- `sync_user(store, user_id, parsed, auto_join_default, …)` → upserts through the SAME planned-meeting
  store primitives `POST /meetings` uses (advisory-locked). Intent rows follow the feed; FSM rows
  are never touched; a manual plan on the same link is ADOPTED (uid stamped), not duplicated;
  vanished/cancelled UIDs retire their still-planned rows. Two rules the whole-row semantics rest on:
  `auto_join` is DERIVED from the connected calendars' policy **unless** the user pinned it on that
  row (`data.auto_join_user_set`, written by `PATCH /meetings/{id}`), and rows imported before plural
  calendars — bare `data.calendar_uid`, no sources — are claimed only by the `legacy=True` connection,
  which is also the one that may retire them.
- `fetch_ics(url, client=None)` — **SSRF-pinned** (`webhooks/ssrf.build_pinned_transport`), 2 MB cap,
  no redirects; pass a `build_ics_client()` to share one connection pool across a sweep.
  `fetch_configs(admin_api_url, secret)` — the internal discovery hop.

## Wiring (entrypoint)
`meeting_api.__main__._attach_background_loops` runs one sweep per `CALENDAR_SYNC_INTERVAL_S`
(default 300 s): configs → grouped by user → up to `CALENDAR_SYNC_CONCURRENCY` users at a time,
each reading its meeting rows ONCE and threading them through that user's calendars over one shared
pinned client (per-user try/except — one bad feed never stalls the sweep) → WS frames per changed
row → `cal:sync:{user_id}` redis stamp (`last_sync`/`last_error`/counts, read back by the terminal's
calendar popover). A config arrives in one of three shapes: live (feed URL), `deleted` (tombstone),
or `paused` (`enabled: false`) — the latter two parse as an empty feed, so a disconnected or paused
calendar leaves no meeting armed. Unset `ADMIN_API_URL`/`INTERNAL_API_SECRET` → the loop no-ops
(capability degrade, not boot-fail).

## Dependencies
`icalendar` + `python-dateutil` (both FINOS Category A), imported lazily. Depends on
`collector` (meeting_link + the planned-meeting store port) and `webhooks.ssrf` only.
