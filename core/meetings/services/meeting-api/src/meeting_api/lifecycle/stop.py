"""The user-stop path — DELETE /bots → request the bot leave, classify its exit (P3b).

Port of the parent ``meetings.stop_bot`` control-plane behaviour, reduced to the FSM seam:

  * **request_stop(record, publisher)** — mark the record's ``stop_requested`` (the parent's
    ``meeting.data["stop_requested"]`` — the canonical user-intent signal the exit classifier reads
    first) and PUBLISH a ``bot_commands:meeting:{meeting_id}`` ``{"action":"leave"}`` command (the
    parent's leave-command publish). The bot, hearing it, leaves and emits a terminal lifecycle
    event; that event is then classified (below) WITH a reason — never a silent jump to terminal.

  * **classify_user_stop(record)** — the parent's Pack-C/Pack-J rule, reduced: a user stop is NEVER
    a failure regardless of stage. While the meeting was still ``joining``/``awaiting_admission`` the
    bot is asked to leave; its terminal exit lands as ``completed(stopped)`` — a TERMINAL state with
    the ``stopped`` reason, attributed to ``transition_source=user_stop`` — not a silent jump.

The leave command + the ``stop_requested`` flag are the two effects the eval asserts. The publisher
is a port (``LeaveCommandPublisher``) so the eval drives it with fakeredis / an in-memory capture.
