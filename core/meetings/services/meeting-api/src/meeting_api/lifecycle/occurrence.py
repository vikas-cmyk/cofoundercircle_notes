"""May a calendar OCCURRENCE be dispatched a bot again, given how its last run ended?

One decision, one table. Calendar sync recreates a terminal row's occurrence so the auto-join sweep
can retry it (#1200); this module decides whether that occurrence is still *owed* a bot at all.

The bug this exists to close (stage rev 192, witnessed live): meeting 26312 ended
``completed``/``stopped`` at 22:28:31 — the bot had joined, done its job, and been deliberately
stopped. Sync recreated the occurrence as 26313 at 22:28:46, the sweep's 300s backoff since 22:21:01
had legitimately elapsed, and at 22:28:47 an uninvited bot walked back into the founder's meeting.
The retry gate was a RATE limit (how recently did we try?) where it needed an ELIGIBILITY rule
(should we ever try again?). Backoff cannot fix "never".

The rule, in priority order:

1. **USER_STOPPED** — positive evidence the user stopped it (``data.stop_requested``, or
   ``completion_reason='stopped'``). Final for the occurrence at ANY lifecycle stage: a stop pressed
   while the bot sat in the waiting room is the user saying no just as loudly as one pressed
   mid-meeting. Founder ruling 2026-08-17: *"explicit stop must be stop"*.
2. **SERVED** — the bot reached the room and the visit is over. ``status='completed'`` (the FSM
   admits COMPLETED only from ACTIVE — see ``machine.LEGAL_TRANSITIONS`` — so every completed row is
   a row whose bot got in), or ``status='failed'`` with ``failure_stage='active'`` (admitted, then
   the run broke). A second bot here is a second visit, not a retry.
3. **RETRY** — failure class, and the bot never reached the room. Only these stay eligible, and only
   behind the sweep's backoff (#1200's storm ceiling: one dispatch per backoff per occurrence).

The retry set is DERIVED from the sealed taxonomy already in ``retry.py`` (TRANSIENT =
``join_failure`` / ``awaiting_admission_timeout``) plus two values that taxonomy does not carry:

* ``start_failed`` — written straight to ``data.completion_reason`` by ``fail_meeting`` and NOT a
  member of the sealed ``CompletionReason`` enum. The workload never started, so the bot never got
  near the meeting; that is the most retryable failure there is.
* absent/unknown reason — no producer emits one today (the bot stamps a reason on every terminal
  edge, and ``reconcile`` derives one), so this is legacy and synthetic rows. Retryable ONLY because
  rule 2 already caught the shape that matters: a reason-less row whose ``failure_stage`` is
  ``active`` is SERVED. Without positive evidence the bot was admitted, the pre-#1200 behaviour
  stands and the backoff bounds it.

Every other reason is SERVED: the host rejected us (``awaiting_admission_rejected``), the profile is
signed out (``auth_session_missing``), the request was malformed (``validation_error``), or the
reason belongs to the active phase at all (``evicted``, ``left_alone``, ``startup_alone``,
``max_bot_time_exceeded``) — in which case the bot was in the room whatever the stage says.
