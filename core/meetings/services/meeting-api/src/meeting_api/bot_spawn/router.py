"""The ``POST /bots`` route — mounts the bot-spawn flow onto the unified meeting-api app.

A mountable ``APIRouter`` (the modular-monolith composition, P2). The caller's identity arrives in
the ``x-user-id`` header the gateway injects after it resolves ``x-api-key`` (the gateway strips any
client-supplied identity header first — anti-spoofing). The route maps the spawn outcomes onto the
HTTP status the gateway forwards verbatim:

  * 201 + ``api.v1`` MeetingResponse on success,
  * 409 when the user already has an active meeting for (platform, native_id),
  * 429 when the runtime kernel rejects the spawn for owner quota,
  * 502 when the kernel could not start the workload.
