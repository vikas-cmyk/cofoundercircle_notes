"""PUBLISHING MEETING FACTS INTO FLOWS — meetings tells, it does not ask.

F168/F181: an ad hoc bot — one started via the MCP `request_meeting_bot` verb, never through a
calendar invite — never produced a `post_meeting` reaction. Only `invite_intake` (flows' own flow)
ever told flows that a meeting started or finished (`emit_started` / `emit_completed`,
`flows_defs/production.py`, PRD decision 42.2); meeting-api's only outbound door was the operator
webhook (`webhooks/system.py`), and flows does not read it. This module is the missing edge:
meeting-api telling flows itself, the way identity's `admin_api/app/events.py` already tells it
about onboarding and agent-api's `control_plane/publish.py` already tells it about desk facts. Copy
those two files' argument before you copy their code — it is the same argument one layer down.

A PUBLISH EDGE IS NOT A DEPENDENCY:

  * a DEPENDENCY is a call whose answer the caller needs. This module has none — nothing the
    lifecycle callback does branches on whether flows heard about it.
  * a PUBLISH is a fact handed over. Best-effort, bounded, swallowed. A deployment with no flows
    domain runs meetings exactly as one with a flows domain does, and so does one where flows is
    down or slow — that is a PROFILE, not a degraded state.

So `VEXA_FLOWS_API_URL` / `VEXA_FLOWS_API_KEY` are declared as a `publish-edge` in `config.v1.json`,
matching agent-api's own spelling of the URL key (identity's admin-api spelled it bare
`FLOWS_API_URL` until F208, which aligned it to the name the other two publishers already used; the
bare name is still honoured there for one release, with a boot warning).

THE SOURCE_EVENT_ID MATCHES FLOWS' OWN SCHEME ON PURPOSE (`live-<meeting_id>` / `done-<meeting_id>`
— see `meeting_started_source_id` / `meeting_completed_source_id`), not a meeting-api-flavoured
id. flows admits on `(source_event_id, flow)` (`flows/admission.py`): the same id from two
producers is one reaction, not two. `invite_intake` still runs its own `emit_started` /
`emit_completed` for calendar-intake meetings, and will until it is retired — matching ids is what
lets this ship as a SECOND, redundant, self-deduping producer today rather than requiring that
retirement first. A meeting-api-flavoured id would double-fire `post_meeting` on every calendar
meeting the day this lands.

WHAT THIS BUYS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT: it makes an ad hoc meeting reach `live_meeting` /
`post_meeting` for the first time. It does NOT carry an invite's `participants` / `group` —
meeting-api's domain holds no invite, so it cannot state who was invited, only who spawned the
bot (`uid`) and which call it was (`meeting_id` / `native` / `platform`). For a calendar-intake
meeting the DUAL-PRODUCER race usually resolves in THIS module's favour on `meeting.completed` (it
fires the instant the DB row flips to `completed`; `invite_intake`'s own `emit_completed` only
fires after its next poll tick) — so `process_meeting`'s room-read (`flows_steps/meeting.py
room_order`) degrades to an EMPTY room rather than to invite order on that path, until
`invite_intake`'s producer is retired or this module is taught to carry participants too. Flagged,
not silently absorbed — see the filed issue.

#: Bounded on purpose. Both publishes run inside the lifecycle callback a bot's own HTTP round
#: trip is waiting on, so the ceiling on how slow flows can make that callback is this number, not
#: flows' own timeout.
#:
#: AND THE BOUND IS ONLY REAL BECAUSE THE CALL IS ASYNC. This used to be
#: ``urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=TIMEOUT_S)`` — a BLOCKING call on the event loop inside
#: ``async def _apply_lifecycle_event``, which is the same loop that runs the segment consumer, the
#: db-writer, the live transcript reads and ``/health``. Two things were wrong with it and only one
#: of them was the 2 s: urllib's ``timeout`` is a SOCKET timeout, so name resolution is not covered
#: at all — an unresolvable ``VEXA_FLOWS_API_URL`` stalled the whole process for as long as the
#: resolver took, not for two seconds. ``httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=…)`` bounds connect (DNS
#: included), write, read and pool acquisition, and awaits instead of blocking, so a slow or dead
#: flows costs THIS callback its bound and costs every other coroutine nothing.
