"""``meeting.data`` on the API response: two tiers, decided by WHO is reading.

The meeting row's ``data`` blob is shared. Besides the meeting's own content it carries state other
parts of the system stamped there — the per-user webhook config (``bot_spawn`` writes it so the
lifecycle callback can deliver), the transcript-share grants and viewer roster, the
authenticated-session path. The reads that ship ``data`` authorize more than the owner: owner **or**
transcript-share recipient **or** member of the bound workspace (the access union ``list_meetings``
documents). So the response edge projects — but not with one rule for everybody:

**Tier 1 · never shipped, to anyone** (``SENSITIVE_OMIT_KEYS`` + anything credential-SHAPED):
``webhook_secret``, ``share_grants``, ``auth_userdata_path``. Credential material and other people's
material. The owner is not excluded — they have dedicated endpoints for all three, and no meeting
response is the right carrier.

**Tier 2 · the owner's, and only the owner's** (``OWNER_ONLY_KEYS``): ``webhook_url``,
``webhook_events``, ``transcript_viewers``. Owner-private but not credentials. The v0.10 REST
contract promises the owner their own webhook config back on their own meeting row — the compat
suite's ``test_10_user_webhook_config_flow`` reads ``data.webhook_url`` out of ``GET /meetings``
after a spawn — so stripping it from the owner is a backward-compatibility break, not a hardening.
Stripped for everyone else: a transcript-share recipient was given a transcript, not the owner's
endpoint configuration, and must not be able to enumerate who ELSE the meeting was shared with.

Both load-bearing cases have a test on every edge (list · meeting detail · transcript detail · PATCH
echo · **the spawn response**): the owner keeps tier 2, a second user holding nothing but a redeemed
share link keeps neither, and nobody at all sees tier 1.

``POST /bots`` is the edge that was missing, and it is the worst one to miss: the spawn request is
the one that WRITES the signing secret onto the row, and its 201 handed the secret straight back
(found in production 2026-09-05 through the MCP's ``request_meeting_bot`` result,
fr_2261a6306224c6f8). ``bot_spawn.service._meeting_response`` built the response body by copying
``row["data"]`` verbatim rather than going through this module — which is the whole argument for
having ONE projection: a route does not leak by deciding to, it leaks by not calling.

The projection is a RESPONSE-edge transform and must not disturb the stored row — the delivery path
reads the signing secret out of the meeting row at send time — so the last two tests sign a real
delivery after a read has been served.
