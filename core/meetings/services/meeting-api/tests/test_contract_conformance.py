"""gate:contract-conformance — the SHIPPED meeting-api conforms to the sealed api.v1 (P8).

The contract (``core/gateway/contracts/api.v1/api.schema.json``, "Vexa API Gateway" 1.5.0) is the
spec; the gateway proxies the public surface VERBATIM to meeting-api, so meeting-api is the
implementation behind every meeting-domain api.v1 route. ``gate:schema`` proves goldens ≡ schema and
``gate:contract-version`` freezes the seal, but NOTHING proved the *running service* conforms to the
sealed surface — and it drifted: api.v1 declares routes meeting-api never implemented (A1/A2 in
MATURITY-FINDINGS.md), and the conformance harness drove a FAKE meeting-api (gateway_conformance/
fake_meeting_api.py) that implements them, MASKING the gap. The fake conformed; the real app did not.

This is the OFFLINE STRUCTURAL half: import the real ``create_app()``, enumerate its registered
routes, and compare the (path, method) set against the sealed api.v1 CORE surface, asserting:

  (a) every api.v1-covered route the real app IMPLEMENTS conforms to a declared (path, method) —
      a route that drifts from the contract's spelling is a bug; and
  (b) every api.v1 CORE/named route is EITHER implemented OR on the explicit, reasoned ``WAIVED``
      list below — so KNOWN drift is bounded + documented, and NEW unwaived drift turns the gate RED.

DO NOT widen by editing api.v1 or the seal — reconciling the contract itself (implement the route, or
remove it from api.v1) is a human-gated ``lane:contract`` change (P4); the waiver is the correct
interim record of the gap (ADR-0022: source states the designed present; the gap lives in the ledger).

L4 EXTENSION (bbb, out of scope here): live input-fuzzing — schemathesis run against the RUNNING
gateway's OpenAPI to prove request/response BODIES conform under hostile input — is the dynamic half
that needs the real stack. This gate is the offline structural half (routes registered ≡ routes declared).
