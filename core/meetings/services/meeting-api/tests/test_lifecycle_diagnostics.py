"""P3a eval — lifecycle diagnostics (attributable reasons).

Replays a lifecycle.v1 event per terminal cause through the FSM (via the HTTP receiver) and
asserts the resulting meeting record + the emitted `meeting.status_change` webhook carry the
CORRECT attribution for each:

  * `completion_reason` / `failure_stage` (DERIVED SERVER-SIDE from the meeting's status at
    write-time, never the bot's stale payload),
  * `error_details`,
  * a `status_transition[]` trail (one entry per hop, each stamped with `transition_source`),
  * `bot_logs` / `bot_resources` forensics landed in `record.data`.

Each terminal-cause event is validated against the SEALED lifecycle.v1 schema before it is
replayed (the seam, P8), and each emitted webhook is the SEALED webhook.v1 `Envelope`. OFFLINE —
TestClient + in-memory store, no docker, no meeting, no network.
