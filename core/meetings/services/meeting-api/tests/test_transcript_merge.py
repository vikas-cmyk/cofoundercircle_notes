"""#508 · A3 direct coverage of the REFACTORED SqlAlchemyTranscriptStore (not the in-memory fake).

The collector fake-lane exercises ``InMemoryTranscriptStore``; this pins the actual changed code —
``SqlAlchemyTranscriptStore._merge_live_segments`` (the post-session half that assembles the
response and merges the live Redis hash). It needs no SQLAlchemy (the DB half ``_transcript_pg_part``
is gated by test_tx_scope + the live A2/A3 probes); it drives the merge with a redis stub, so a
regression in field set / key order / sort / absolute-time derivation / the Redis merge is caught
offline. The Redis-only-segment assertion IS the negative control: delete the post-session merge and
``s-redis`` disappears → this test goes red (the same guard the issue names at adapters.py:237-239).
