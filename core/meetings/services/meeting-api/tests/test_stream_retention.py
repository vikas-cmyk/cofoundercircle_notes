"""#527 · C2/A2 — bounded stream retention that NEVER ages out an un-consumed entry.

On 2026-04-26 the stream's MAXLEN trim aged out entries before the (hung) consumer read them → 20
meetings' transcripts permanently lost. The retention here trims only entries that are BOTH older
than the window AND already consumed (acked, and behind the group's last-delivered-id). Un-acked
(pending) and undelivered (lag) entries always survive. Driven against fakeredis — no real redis.
