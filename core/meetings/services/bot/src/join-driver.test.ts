/**
 * join-driver seam (G1) — a TYPED `AdmissionError` outcome must map to the right `JoinOutcome`, so a
 * host DENIAL is recorded as a PERMANENT `rejected` (→ `awaiting_admission_rejected`), not collapsed
 * into a TRANSIENT, RETRIED `join_failure`. Regression for the wasted-respawn-on-denial bug: before the
 * fix the admission wait's throw fell through to the orchestrator's blanket `join_failure` catch, and
 * `lifecycle/retry.py` re-spawned a bot that was actually denied.
 *
 * Run: tsx src/join-driver.test.ts
