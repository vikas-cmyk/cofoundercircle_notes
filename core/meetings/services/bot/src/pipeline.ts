/**
 * Pipeline adapter (2b) — the capture → lane → STT → transcript.v1 engine, behind the
 * orchestrator's Pipeline port.
 *
 * The bot rewires NOTHING about transcription topology: the per-channel lane (turn gating,
 * LocalAgreement confirmation, glow→channel naming) lives in @vexa/gmeet-pipeline, the mixed
 * lane (pyannote cut + hints naming, no diarizer) in @vexa/mixed-pipeline, and the stt.v1
 * round-trip in @vexa/transcribe-whisper. This adapter only:
 *   1. picks the lane on inv.platform (google_meet → native per-channel; teams → CSRC virtual
 *      channels over the shared GMeet window; zoom/jitsi → legacy mixed segmentation),
 *   2. injects the stt port (TranscriptionClient.transcribe) + a TranscriptSink, and
 *   3. RECONCILES the lane's TranscriptSink (segment/draft/finalize — owned by the lane's
 *      transcript.v1 contract) onto the bot's injected TranscriptSink.publish(segment) port.
 *
 * The capture BRIDGE (browser page-side capture → feedAudio) lives in capture-bridge.ts and is
 * L4-gated; this file is the offline-provable lane composition (L2/L3 via pipeline.test.ts:
 * synthetic PCM → mock transcribe → assert publish got transcript.v1-valid segments).
 *
 * Ported from services/vexa-bot_new/src/pipeline/gmeet-pipeline.ts (the lane wrapper) onto the
 * v0.12 ports; Teams now wires @vexa/mixed-pipeline's CSRC/GMeet lane while Zoom/Jitsi retain
 * ChunkedTranscriber.

 * The LIVE pipeline (composition-root seam) — THE #593 FIX. Wraps the page-side capture + recording

 *
 * Once the bot is admitted, a post-admission subsystem failure — a page-side capture/MediaRecorder
 * throw, or the mixed-lane pyannote model load rejecting (empty HF cache / no egress) — must DEGRADE
 * LOUDLY, never propagate out of `start()`. The orchestrator's backstop maps ANY `pipeline.start()`
 * throw to `leave('pipeline_start_failed')` + `join_failure` (correct for a truly unrecoverable
 * pipeline, and deliberately preserved), so keeping every recoverable failure INSIDE this seam is
 * what stops the ~120 ms self-evict. Every failure routes to `onFault` (→ console + the transcript
 * fault publisher → meeting-page banner) so "admitted but not transcribing" is loud, not silent.
 *
 * Browser-free BY CONSTRUCTION (takes thunks; imports no playwright/DOM) so it is L2-unit-provable
 * offline — the admitted→capture-start seam no unit covered before (#593 A4). index.ts binds the
 * thunks to the live page.
