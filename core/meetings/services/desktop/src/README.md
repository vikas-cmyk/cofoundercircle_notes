# desktop/src

[`desktop.ts`](desktop.ts) — the host: `startDesktop()` wires the ingest WS (decode `capture.v1`
→ `gmeet-pipeline` → real STT) to an in-memory store + the gateway. Gateway routes:
`POST /extension/sessions` (mint), `POST /extension/sessions/end` (finalize a session NOW — dispose
the pipeline, flush the recording, mark completed; the extension's Stop contract), `POST /telemetry`
(accept the extension's JSON diagnostics into a ring buffer — never 404s) + `GET /telemetry` (read it
back), `GET /transcripts/{p}/{n}`, `GET /bots`, `GET /recordings/{p}/{n}` (the assembled master) +
`GET /recordings/{p}/{n}/player` (a dependency-free HTML5 `<audio>` page for it), `/ws`.

[`recording-sink.ts`](recording-sink.ts) — the **recording.v1 receiver PORT** (P5; see ADR-0005). A
pure assembly core (no WS, no disk): accumulates recording.v1 chunks per session and on `is_final`
assembles the master via `@vexa/recording` `buildRecordingMaster`, handing the bytes to an injected
`onMaster`. `desktop.ts` fills `onMaster` with the disk-write + gateway-serve adapter.

Tests (`gate:node` runs all three): [`recording-sink.test.ts`](recording-sink.test.ts) is the **L2**
unit (synthetic chunks via an in-memory fake → assert the assembled master); [`recording-e2e.test.ts`](recording-e2e.test.ts)
is the **L3** integration (synthetic recording.v1 over the real ingest WS → decode → sink → a REAL file
on disk → served by the gateway; no live meeting); [`desktop-e2e.live.test.ts`](desktop-e2e.live.test.ts)
is the end-to-end transcript gate against real STT (skips without `VEXA_TX_KEY` + `EVAL_CACHE`).
