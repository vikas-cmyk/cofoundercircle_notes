"""THE MANIFESTS IN THIS REPO ARE VALID, AND THEY ARE WHAT THE DOMAINS SERVE.

Each domain commits its manifest in its own directory and serves that same file at
`/.well-known/mcp-tools.json`. This test reads them off disk and puts them through the assembler,
so a manifest that could not boot the edge fails here instead — in the suite of the service that
would have refused to start.
