"""A TOOL SAYS WHICH CREDENTIAL ITS DOOR TAKES — issue #1468 C2.

The manifest could say who the CALLER must be (`identity`) and nothing at all about what this edge
has to PRESENT to the door behind the tool. So the edge did the only thing it could: forward the
caller's own credential to everything, and find out at call time. Flows' four tools were behind a
deployment-wide operator key this edge does not hold and must never hold, and the result reached the
agent as a JSON-RPC answer with a 401 inside it — a tool that is in `tools/list` and cannot work.

`auth` closes that at BOOT, where every other rule in this assembler already lives:

    subject   the caller's own credential travels, which is what this edge does today
    admin     a deployment-held key travels instead — and the deployment must actually hold it
    none      nothing travels

A tool whose `auth` this deployment cannot satisfy is REFUSED AT ASSEMBLY, naming it. Not published
and 401ing later: an agent that cannot see a tool recovers; an agent told a tool exists and handed a
refusal tells the person the product is broken. That is the same fail-direction as every other rule
in `manifest.py`, applied to the one fact the contract could not express.
