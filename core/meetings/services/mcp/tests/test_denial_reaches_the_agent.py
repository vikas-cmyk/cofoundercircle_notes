"""When a bot is refused, the AGENT must be told enough to do something about it.

`request_meeting_bot` is the tool a person's agent calls, so it is the surface where a refusal
either becomes actionable or becomes a dead end. Upstream answers
`403 {"detail": {"code", "reason", "decision_id", "message"?, "action_url"?}}`; the last two are
authored by whichever service decided, are optional, and are the only part of that body a human or
an agent can act on. A `reason` slug alone tells an agent that something is closed and nothing
about what would open it.

Both halves are pinned here because they fail differently and silently:

  * the **forwarding route** (`make_request`) must carry the upstream JSON body into the raised
    error rather than flattening it to a status line, and
  * the **mounted `/mcp` transport** — what the agent actually reads — must surface those fields in
    the tool result's text, marked `isError`.

The second is the one nothing else covers. `fastapi-mcp` renders a failed tool call by embedding
the response body in an error string, so the fields ride along today for free — which is exactly
why it needs a test: an error-envelope change in that library, or a `detail`-to-string tidy-up in
this service, would drop the words with every existing test still green.

Fixture-local strings only: no plan, price, currency or URL of ours appears here.
