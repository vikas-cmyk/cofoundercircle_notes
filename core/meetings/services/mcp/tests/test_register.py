"""REGISTRATION — an assembled tool becomes a tool an agent can actually call.

A bound tool is turned into one FastAPI route on this service, carrying `operation_id=<tool name>`,
which is exactly how this service's own fourteen tools become MCP tools (`FastApiMCP` reads the
OpenAPI it generates). One mechanism for both, so an assembled tool and a built-in one are
indistinguishable to a client — which is the point of assembling rather than proxying.

The forward carries THE CALLER'S IDENTITY and nothing else: the bearer the edge already resolved,
travelling as `X-API-Key`, exactly as the fourteen do. There is no second credential and no way to
pass one as an argument (PRD 40.8).
