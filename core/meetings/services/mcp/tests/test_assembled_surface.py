"""END TO END — a domain's manifest becomes a tool an agent sees in `tools/list`.

The point of assembling rather than proxying: an assembled tool and one of this service's own
fourteen are indistinguishable to a client, because both are a route with `operation_id=<name>` that
`FastApiMCP` reads out of the same OpenAPI.

The flows manifest used here is THE FILE IN THE REPO — `core/flows/mcp.tools.v1.json`, the same one
flows-api serves at `/.well-known/mcp-tools.json`. If that file stops being assemblable, this fails.
