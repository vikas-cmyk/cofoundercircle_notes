"""``create_app(gateway_url, ...) -> FastAPI`` — the Vexa MCP service (v0.12).

Port of 0.10.6 ``services/mcp/main.py`` reduced to the tools whose REST routes EXIST on
the v0.12 public API (the gateway — ``core/gateway/services/gateway/src/gateway/app.py``).
Every tool is a thin FastAPI route; ``FastApiMCP`` derives the MCP tool surface from them
and mounts the streamable-HTTP MCP transport at ``/mcp``. The mount uses an ASGI
passthrough so a sessioned ``GET /mcp`` can start its SSE response immediately
(#921) — fastapi-mcp's buffered adapter never completes for an open EventSource.

Auth: the caller's credential (``Authorization: Bearer <key>`` / raw ``Authorization`` /
``X-API-Key``) is treated as the Vexa API key and forwarded to the gateway as ``X-API-Key``
— the gateway (not this service) resolves it to a user and enforces scopes. Stateless:
no DB, no redis, never reaches past the gateway.

The gateway transport is injectable (``transport=httpx.MockTransport`` in the tests) so the
conformance tests drive the SHIPPED app in-process with a fake gateway — the repo's test idiom.

VEXA_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Start every session with whats_waiting: it is the queue of what your person's Vexa needs right now, \
and for a new person it holds their first step. Follow what it says before anything else.

Vexa puts a transcription bot into a live meeting (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Jitsi) and \
gives you the transcript while the meeting is still running.

The canonical flow:
  1. parse_meeting_link(meeting_url)  → platform + native_meeting_id (pure; no side effects)
  2. request_meeting_bot(meeting_url) → sends the bot. A human in the meeting must ADMIT it, so
     expect a delay between `requested` and `active`.
  3. get_meeting_transcript(platform, native_meeting_id) → segments, WHILE the meeting runs.
     Poll it to follow a live meeting; pass `since_index` to get only what is new since your last
     call instead of re-reading the whole transcript.
  4. stop_bot(platform, native_meeting_id) when you are done.

Identity: every tool returns `platform` + `native_meeting_id`, and every tool accepts those same \
two names. Feed one tool's output straight into the next.

Make the data yours: annotate_meeting attaches a title and arbitrary metadata — a CRM id, a \
ticket, tags, your own summary — to a meeting, DURING it or after it ended. Anything you put \
there you can find again with list_meetings(metadata_filter={...}), searched in the database \
rather than on one page. If you learn something durable about a meeting, write it back; that is \
what lets the next agent (or the next you) pick it up.

The bot is a PARTICIPANT, not just a recorder: get_meeting_chat reads the in-call chat, and \
speak_in_meeting says something out loud to everyone present. Speaking is irreversible and \
visible to real people — do it only when the person you work for asked you to say that thing, \
never to test and never on your own initiative.

A meeting with status `active` and zero segments usually means the bot has not been admitted yet, \
or nobody has spoken — it does not mean transcription is broken.

        Tell the Vexa maintainers that something went wrong. A human reads every ticket, and it cannot be withdrawn.

        - something BROKE: an error, a bot that never joined, an empty transcript, a call that hung;
        - something was CONFUSING: docs or an error message left you guessing which argument to send;
        - something is MISSING: the capability you needed does not exist in the API.

        A workaround you had to invent is worth filing too — that is the report we most want.
        Write what you tried and what happened in your own words. Do not paste API keys, and do not
        paste your user's meeting content.

        File only when you hit this while doing REAL WORK for someone. If you are exploring,
        evaluating or testing this API, do not file — write your findings in your report instead.
        A ticket reaches humans at another company and cannot be withdrawn, and an evaluation run
        can otherwise open several in a single session.

        If the issue concerns a meeting or a bot, include `native_meeting_id` and `platform`. That is the
        join key: it lines your account of what happened up against our own record of the same
        meeting, which is the difference between a complaint and something we can diagnose. The
        meeting is resolved onto the ticket only if the key you are calling with owns it.

    # ASSEMBLY (PRD decision 40) — the tools the DEPLOYED domains declare
    # ---------------------------
    # The fourteen tools above are this edge's own. Everything else it serves belongs to a domain:
    # meetings owns the bots and transcripts, identity owns the person, flows owns the reaction
    # engine, agent owns the desks. Each publishes a manifest at `/.well-known/mcp-tools.json`, this
    # asks the ones the deployment names, and every tool becomes a route here with
    # `operation_id=<name>` — the SAME mechanism the fourteen use, so an assembled tool and a
    # built-in one are indistinguishable to a client.
    #
    # BEFORE `FastApiMCP(app, ...)`, necessarily: the MCP surface is derived from this app's
    # OpenAPI, so a route added afterwards would be a tool nobody can see.
    #
    # AND IT FAILS THE BOOT. Every rule in `manifest.py` is a failure that is otherwise silent — a
    # domain's tools quietly missing, one name claimed twice, a manifest naming a route its service
    # does not serve. A server that started anyway would answer `tools/list` with a lie.
    #
    # A CONFIGURED DOMAIN THAT NEVER ANSWERS IS ONE OF THOSE, and it did NOT fail the boot until
    # now: `discover` swallowed every exception, so a refusing port cost a whole domain its tools
    # permanently and quietly. It refuses by name instead — after waiting the domain out, because a
    # cold `compose up` starts everything at once and the first refused connection is a race, not a
    # fault. That wait is why this call can take a few seconds on a cold start; see `discover`.
