"""REGISTRATION — an assembled tool becomes one route on this service, and therefore one MCP tool.

`FastApiMCP` derives the MCP surface from this app's OpenAPI: a route with `operation_id=<name>` IS
a tool called `<name>`. That is how the fourteen built-in tools work, so assembling through the same
mechanism makes an assembled tool and a built-in one indistinguishable to a client — which is the
whole point of assembling rather than proxying, and the reason there is no second code path to keep
in step.

WHAT TRAVELS: whichever credential the tool's `auth` names, and nothing else (issue #1468).
`subject` sends the caller's own, as `X-API-Key`, exactly as the fourteen do — the case this edge
was built for. `admin` sends the key the DEPLOYMENT holds, in the header the owning domain named,
and the caller's own credential does NOT travel with it: a door that reads an operator key has no
use for a person's, and forwarding both would let the weaker one look like it was checked.
`none` sends neither.

There is one authentication path INTO this edge (PRD 40.8) — a bearer in the header, the session
bound by `Mcp-Session-Id` — so a tool cannot take a credential as an argument and this forward
cannot invent one. What goes out of the edge is a different question, and it is the manifest that
answers it; whether the deployment can answer it at all was already settled at assembly.

WHAT DOES NOT TRAVEL: anything the manifest did not declare. An argument the owning route ignores is
the worst reply available to an agent — it reports success for something that did not happen — so an
undeclared parameter is dropped here rather than forwarded and silently discarded there.

AND THE ROUTE IS BUILT WITH A REAL SIGNATURE, which is not a detail (issue #1468). The MCP tool's
input schema is derived from THIS app's OpenAPI, and FastAPI derives that from the endpoint's
parameters — so an endpoint taking only `request` published a tool with NO arguments at all. Every
declared argument disappeared between `bind`, which had just verified each one against the owning
route, and the surface. With the schema closed (`additionalProperties: false`, correctly) the effect
was not a silent drop but a refusal: `reactions_list` could not filter, and `reaction_signal` could
not be called at all, because `/reactions/{reaction_id}/{verb}` cannot be addressed without its two
path parameters and an agent could not see that they existed.

So the signature is BUILT — one query parameter per path parameter (required: the route cannot be
addressed without them) and one per declared argument (optional, carrying the owning route's own
type and description). It also re-arms the app-wide unknown-argument guard, which reads a route's
declared query parameters and would otherwise refuse every argument to every assembled tool.

    AS AN ANNOTATION (`examples`), NEVER AS `enum`.

    An argument published as a bare `string` tells an agent nothing about which words the route
    understands, and an agent that has to guess a word guesses wrong: twelve friction reports were
    thrown away on prod in twenty minutes because `kind` reached `tools/list` as an open string
    (F-D26). So the vocabulary has to travel. The question is in which key.

    IT MUST NOT TRAVEL AS `enum`, and that was caught on the station rather than reasoned out. The
    MCP SDK's own dispatcher validates a call's arguments against the tool's `inputSchema`
    (`mcp/server/lowlevel/server.py`: `jsonschema.validate(instance=arguments,
    schema=tool.inputSchema)`) and returns `isError` without ever calling the tool. A first cut
    published `enum` here; `report_friction` with `kind="broke"` came back "Input validation error:
    'broke' is not one of [...]" and the report was destroyed one hop EARLIER than before, by the
    fix for the defect. The edge would have become a stricter gate than the route it fronts.

    `examples` is a JSON Schema ANNOTATION: it reaches `tools/list`, an agent reads it, and no
    validator anywhere rejects a value for not being in it. The words themselves are also spelled
    out in the argument's own description, which the owning route writes. Guidance belongs in front
    of the agent; the decision about an unrecognised word belongs to the route that stores it.

    BOTH KEYS ARE READ off the owning route, and that is a real case rather than defensiveness: a
    route that has decided its own vocabulary is a suggestion publishes `examples`, and a route
    that validates against a closed set publishes `enum`. An agent needs the words either way, and
    either way this edge must not be the thing that refuses the call for not using them.
