"""THE QUEUE — what flows is holding for ONE PERSON (PRD decision 42.2).

*"what is waiting — maybe it's flows?"* (founder, 2026-09-03 07:43Z; agreed.) What is waiting is
the set of pending REACTIONS flows already holds for this subject. Nothing is unioned at the edge:
other domains publish events, and flow definitions decide what waits.

That ruling is what this module is. Three properties follow from it, and each one is a defect the
four-source version had:

1. **It exists in every profile.** Two of the old tool's four sources were agent-api reads, so the
   verb could not ship in the `no-agents` product (decision 40.6) — it would be absent from most of
   the eight domain configurations, or present and answering half. A read over `reaction` is a read
   over flows' own table, and flows is in every profile.

2. **A short queue is no longer ambiguous.** Every item names the FLOW that produced it and carries
   a TYPED reason, so *"nothing is waiting"* and *"that part of the machine is not deployed here"*
   are different answers rather than the same empty list. `not_present` is in the vocabulary for
   exactly that: a reaction the engine terminated because a domain was absent (`flows/model.py`
   `NotPresent`) is something the person is owed a sentence about, not something to hide.

3. **The words are not here.** Everything a person hears is resolved from `behavior/queue/`, the
   same private-mount-then-showcase order `flows_defs/production.py` already reads prompts through.
   A tool body holding two hundred lines of product copy is a rebuild and a deploy away from every
   rewrite, which is the thing PRD §3.8 exists to stop.

**THE COPY IS ALSO THE FILTER, and that is the load-bearing idea.** A person's reactions include a
great deal of plumbing — an `invite_intake` parked at `await_start` three hours before a call is
pending, and is nobody's business. Rather than a keyword list in a tool deciding what is
interesting, a pending reaction is SPOKEN when behavior has something to say about it and COUNTED
when it does not. Which reactions reach a person is then an admin's file, editable without a
deploy, and the machinery holds no opinion about it at all.

**The friction first-run ask is dropped** (ruling 8/9, founder 2026-09-03 08:53Z): there is no
`friction.first_run` event, no flow and no copy file for one — *a flow that fires once per person
is a heavy way to say hello*. The enforcement is not this comment: every item this module emits
carries the `reaction_id` it came from, so an item nobody's reaction produced cannot be built here.
