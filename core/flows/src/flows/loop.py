    ``emit`` (optional) lets steps publish facts: (event_type, source_id, refs) -> int.

    ``gate`` (optional) is a ZERO-ARG PREDICATE answering "may work run at all?". False parks the
    entire engine — PARK, never drop.

    It is asked BEFORE `claim`, and that position is the whole design. Nothing is leased while the
    gate is up, so there is no lease to expire, no half-run step, and no row for the reconciler to
    reclaim; a fact keeps its `admitted`/`retrying` status, its `next_run_at`, its `attempt` and
    its `reason` exactly as it had them. When the gate opens, everything that arrived during the
    outage runs in the order it arrived, having lost nothing.

    Deliberately NOT done here: pushing `next_run_at` out on the parked rows. It reads like the
    tidier expression of "come back later", and it silently REORDERS the queue — a fact admitted
    one second before the gate opens is due immediately, while a fact admitted an hour earlier was
    pushed a minute into the future and now runs second. Leaving the rows untouched is both
    cheaper and the only version that preserves arrival order. Same reasoning for `attempt`: a
    parked reaction that retried itself into `failed` would be a dropped fact, just slower.

    ``present`` (optional) is a PREDICATE ON A DOMAIN NAME — "is this domain deployed?" — asked of
    every domain a step declared through `@reg.step(needs=…)` BEFORE the body runs. A step whose
    domain is absent answers `NotPresent`: terminal, no retry, and a `reason` on the reaction
    saying which domain was missing (PRD decision 40.7). Asked before the body, so the absent
    door is never knocked on — a step that reached it and caught the connection error would be
    reporting an outage, which is a different fact with a different remedy.

    ``gate`` and ``present`` both default to None — no gate, everything present — so every existing
    caller (the fixtures, the storm, the offline suite) is unchanged, and `flows/` still imports
    nothing from `flows_integrations/` or `flows_steps/`: the engine core does not learn what an
    instance is or which domains a deployment has, the worker injects both.
