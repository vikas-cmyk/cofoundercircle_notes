"""The instance gate — is there a COMPANY behind this Vexa yet?

A fresh Vexa has flows, steps and a mailbox before it has any idea who it works for. The thin
company layer in `_global` — who we are, what we do, who is inside — is written and committed by
the instance administrator during setup, and until that commit lands every recipe in
`flows_defs/production.py` is a machine that will happily mail a stranger on behalf of nobody.
That is the expensive direction. The cheap direction is a touch that arrives a few minutes late.

So this module answers exactly one question — "may work run?" — and it answers it FAIL-CLOSED.
`admin-api` unreachable, a 500, a missing key, a body that is not the document we expect: all of
them read `missing`, because none of them is evidence that setup finished. The only thing that
opens the gate is admin-api saying, in so many words, `global_setup == "completed"`.

    GET {VEXA_FLOWS_ADMIN_API_URL}/admin/instance     header X-Admin-API-Key
      -> {"admin_exists": bool, "global_setup": "completed" | "missing", "company": str | null}

The door is the one the flows tier already holds (`flows_steps.common.ADMIN_API` /
`require_admin_key()`) —
one deployment fact, one variable, never two spellings of one host.

TWO THINGS THIS MODULE IS CAREFUL ABOUT, because both were cheap to get wrong:

* **The cache.** `loop.tick` runs continuously — once per second on an idle worker, far more often
  under load — and it asks the gate before every reaction. An uncached read would put admin-api
  under a permanent poll from every worker replica, and a gate that DDoSes the service it reads is
  a gate that fails closed for the wrong reason. So the answer is held in-process for ~20s. Setup
  is a once-per-instance event measured in minutes; twenty seconds of staleness costs one delayed
  touch and buys three orders of magnitude fewer requests. `force=True` skips the cache for the
  callers who must not be stale (an operator asking "why is nothing moving?").

* **The log.** "The gate is up" is not one fact, it is two, and an operator staring at
  `flows-worker.log` needs to tell them apart: a gate up because admin-api is DOWN is an incident,
  a gate up because the admin has not finished typing is Tuesday. So every read carries a REASON,
  and the reason is printed on TRANSITION — when it changes — not on every call. A line per tick
  is a line nobody reads; a line per change is the timeline of the incident.

Test/dev seam: `VEXA_FLOWS_INSTANCE_GATE=completed|missing` short-circuits the HTTP read entirely.
It exists so the unit suite and a local rig can drive both sides of the gate with no admin-api and
no network. It is NOT a production switch: setting it in a deployment pins the gate to a constant
and defeats the whole point of asking. Any other value is ignored — a typo must not open the door.
