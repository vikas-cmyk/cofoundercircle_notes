"""mailbox integration — its own process: the REAL inbox becomes facts.

  ICS attachment (with a meeting link)   → invite.received   (dedup: UID + occurrence)
  reply on a registered thread           → mail.reply        (dedup: inbound Message-ID)
  anything else                          → logged, ignored

WHO WE WILL ACT FOR is decided BEFORE any of that, in `flows_integrations/mail_policy`, and it is
the first question this file asks (R-B12). A sender who is neither a known user nor inside the
deployment's own domain allow-list gets no account, no agent turn and no model call — one
quarantine row, and at most one fixed line. Two rate limits, per-sender and global, bound what the
inbox can cost even when every sender is legitimate.

Threading is the law here: a reply routes by In-Reply-To/References looked up in mail_thread —
never by sender. Cursor is durable (mail_cursor row) — restarts resume, never re-admit.

WHICH inbox this is stops at `inbox.get_inbox()` — routing, admission and dedup below are
source-blind by design:

    VEXA_MAIL_INBOX = imap     (default) — IMAP against imap.gmail.com, behaviour unchanged
                    = mailpit           — the dev stack's mail double (REST only, no IMAP)
    VEXA_MAILPIT_URL           — mailpit's HTTP base (default http://127.0.0.1:8025)
    VEXA_MAIL_ADDR             — the address this inbox answers as; mailpit filters on it
    VEXA_MAILPIT_LOOKBACK_S    — re-scan window behind the watermark (default 300)

Every one of those, and the mail-policy keys beside them, is declared in `flows_config.DECLARED`.

Both sources fetch the raw RFC822 source and go through the same parse, so a Gmail invite and a
mailpit invite produce byte-identical facts. See `flows_integrations/inbox.py` for the contracts.

       used to get all three. PRD §16.2, pointed inward: outside the domain, never.

       decides WHICH conversation a reply belongs to — routing by sender remains the
       wrong-mail-answered-onboarding bug and is not coming back. What changed is that the ref no

       a forged `In-Reply-To` — the message id is in the headers of every mail we send — ran an
