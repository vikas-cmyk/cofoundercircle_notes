"""WHO IS CALLING — resolved from the caller's own credential, by the service that owns the answer.

Flows' whole surface used to sit behind one deployment-wide operator key. That key is not a person:
with it `GET /reactions` returns every reaction in the instance and `POST /reactions/{id}/cancel`
cancels any of them. So the MCP edge — which forwards the CALLER's credential and holds none of its
own — could be wired two ways and both were wrong: refuse the person, or hand them the instance.

This module is the third way, and it is deliberately NOT a new answer to "who is this". Identity
owns that answer and publishes it at `/internal/validate`; the gateway is the caller everyone knows
about (`core/gateway/services/gateway/src/gateway/adapters.py:85`). Flows is now a SECOND CALLER of
that ONE resolver, not a second resolver — the distinction P23 is about. Nothing here parses a
token, reads a users table, or decides what a scope means.

THREE ANSWERS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE THAT GETS CONFUSED:

    identity says user 126        ->  Caller(kind="subject", uid="126", email=…)
    identity says "invalid token" ->  SubjectUnknown            -> 401, the caller's problem
    identity does not answer,     ->  IdentityUnavailable       -> 503, OUR problem
      or refuses OUR secret

The third is the whole reason this is a module and not four lines in the route. An oracle that
cannot be reached has NOT reached a verdict on the credential, and reporting one is how #495/#483
turned a gateway hiccup into "your API key is invalid" for every user at once. `adapters.py:99-101`
records that lesson at the gateway; this is the same rule at flows' door, including the case the
gateway does not have: identity answering 403 because OUR internal secret is wrong is a deployment
fault, and telling the person their key is invalid sends them to rotate a key that works.
