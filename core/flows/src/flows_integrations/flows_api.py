"""flows-api — manage workflows FROM OUTSIDE, faster than any image rebuild. FastAPI, house-style
(the same shape as meeting-api/agent-api/admin-api), OpenAPI docs at /docs.

  GET  /flows                       every version (image + DB) + the step vocabulary
  POST /flows                       submit {name, on_event, steps:[names], params?, activate?}
                                    — validated against the deployed vocabulary AT SUBMISSION;
                                    auto-versioned; live in the worker within ~10 s
  POST /events                      admit ONE fact {event_type, source_event_id, refs} — the
                                    intake for producers that are not the mailbox
  POST /flows/{name}/{v}/activate   · POST /flows/{name}/{v}/retire
  GET  /reactions[?status=…]        the operator projection
  POST /reactions/{id}/{retry|resume|cancel}    the signal verbs (audited rows)
  GET  /queue/waiting               WHAT IS WAITING FOR ONE PERSON — the subject-scoped pending
                                    reactions, each naming the flow that produced it and its
                                    typed reason (PRD decision 42.2). The subject is the
                                    authenticated caller's, never an argument.
  GET  /queue/notices               THE STANDING NOTICES ONLY — the say text of the waiting items
                                    whose copy declared itself one (`notice: true` in a
                                    `behavior/queue/` file's front-matter). Same door as
                                    /queue/waiting, a much smaller answer: it is built to be asked
                                    on every call and to ride along with unrelated work.
  GET  /timeline?subject=…          ONE PERSON'S DAY, in order — facts, receipts and the
                                    meetings table merged and scoped to them (PRD decision 31).
                                    Read-only, and it takes the operator key OR the narrower
                                    VEXA_FLOWS_TIMELINE_KEY (see `_timeline_key`).

AUTH, TWO TIERS — because two different callers reach this surface and only one of them is an
operator (issue #1468):

  * THE SUBJECT-SCOPED ROUTES (`GET /flows`, `GET /reactions`, `POST /reactions/{id}/{verb}`,
    `GET /queue/waiting`, `GET /queue/notices`, `GET /timeline`) take EITHER the operator key OR a person's own Vexa
    credential, as a bearer or `X-API-Key`. With a person's credential the subject is DERIVED from
    it, through identity's `/internal/validate` — the one resolver, the same one the gateway asks
    (P23) — and a `subject` argument naming anyone else is refused rather than honoured. The MCP
    edge forwards the caller's own credential and holds none of its own, so this is what makes
    those five tools usable by a person at all: before it, the only way to make them answer was to
    hand the edge the operator key, and the operator key is not a person — it reads every reaction
    in the instance and cancels any of them.
  * THE OPERATOR ROUTES (`POST /flows`, `POST /events`, `POST /events/batch`,
    `POST /flows/{name}/{version}/{action}`) take the operator key and nothing else. They
    configure the machine or admit facts on the instance's behalf; there is no per-person version
    of either.

THE OPERATOR TIER IS MEDIATED TOO (P20/E1, 2026-09-05). The operator key is a credential, not a
person: `Caller(kind="admin")` carries no uid, no email and no owner, so a subject-scoped route it
opened WITHOUT a subject had nothing left to authorize against — and answered with the instance.
`GET /reactions` returned every row a deployment held, and `POST /reactions/{id}/{verb}` gated
ownership behind `if subj:`, so an operator who simply omitted `subject` cancelled ANYONE's
reaction with no check at all. `VEXA_FLOWS_API_KEY` is exported into five compose services. So:
every subject-scoped route now REQUIRES a named subject from any credential that is not a person
(`?subject=`, or the gateway's `X-User-Id` where the route takes one), the ownership check on the
verb runs unconditionally, and there is no instance-wide read left on this surface.

`VEXA_FLOWS_TIMELINE_KEY` is its own tier for the same reason. It used to resolve to
`Caller(kind="admin")` — one line that turned "a key that can do exactly one thing" into a key
that read any person's queue and, through `meetings=true`, minted a gateway token on the named
third party's account. It is now `Caller(kind="timeline")`: `GET /timeline` for a named subject,
no meetings hop, and 403 on every other route by name.

The operator key travels as `X-Flows-Operator-Key`. It used to be `X-Flows-Admin-Key`, which reads
as ADMIN-API's token and is not one — that confusion is on the record: a lane start script carried
a `changeme` for it because whoever wrote the script exported the admin-api key under the name this
service reads. The old header is still accepted for one release, with a deprecation line printed
once per process; a caller sending both is answered on the new one.

NEVER accepts code — steps are reviewed Python in the image; this API composes them (the n8n line
we do not cross).

THE INSTANCE GATE cuts across this surface in three different ways, and the difference is the
point (see `flows_integrations/instance_gate.py`):

  * the two INTAKES (`POST /events`, `POST /events/batch`) still ADMIT while the gate is up — a
    fact that happened, happened, and dropping it at the door would lose it forever. The loop
    parks the reaction; the RESPONSE says so, because a fact that looks accepted and produces
    nothing is indistinguishable from a broken product.
  * the two OPERATOR VERBS (`POST /flows`, `POST /flows/{name}/{v}/{action}`) REFUSE with 409:
    they configure the machine, and configuring it before it knows who it works for is precisely
    what the gate exists to prevent.
  * READING (`GET /flows`, `GET /reactions`) stays open. An admin must be able to see the machine
    they are about to configure."""

    not, and the reason was not that the data was missing: every one of those moments is already a
    reaction row or an effect receipt in this database. What was missing was a read along the axis
    a person thinks in. This is that read.

    `subject` is a platform uid or an email address, and the route resolves the OTHER one before it
    scopes, because the invite lineage carries an organizer and no uid while the completed lineage
    carries a uid and, without the resolution, nothing to match an address on. Scoping on one of
    them silently returns half a day — see `flows_timeline.model.concerns`.

    A PERSON does not send it: their subject is derived from their own credential, and one naming
    anyone else is refused (issue #1468). An operator still asks about whoever they name.

    `since` / `until` take epoch seconds or ISO-8601; the default window straddles NOW (14 days
    back, 30 forward) because half of what decision 31 asks for is in the future. `limit` keeps the

    Read-only: it admits nothing, signals nothing and writes nothing. It therefore stays open while
    the instance gate is up, exactly like `GET /flows` and `GET /reactions` — an admin must be able

    `meetings=false` drops the gateway hop and answers from this database alone — the offline shape,
    used by the proof and by any caller that cannot reach the gateway.

    `format=text` (a person asking, through the control MCP) and `format=preamble` (the same
    person's agent, told unasked on every dispatch) add a rendered `text`, in THE SUBJECT'S OWN
    ZONE — read here, from `setting(uid, "timezone")`, and not by the caller. That is deliberate:

# "broke" and "confusing" instead of "missing-tool", "error" and "ux" — the tool schema had told it
# nothing, so it guessed, and the sink whose whole job is to catch what did not work refused the
# catch over a spelling.
#
# FOUNDER RULING, 2026-09-04 10:2xZ, which is the shape this route now has: *"we want to catch all
# signal, does not make sense being strict about it, we want rich data, does not have to be too
# structured."* So `kind` and `severity` are STORED AS SENT — free text, no canonicalisation, no
# mapping to `other`, no second field holding the "raw" word, because there is no cooked one. Any
# argument this route does not name is KEPT too, under `extra`. The eight kinds below survive only
# as SUGGESTIONS in the tool description; grouping happens on the data later, by whoever reads it,
# never at the door.
#
# F-D27, prod 2026-09-04 11:0xZ, is the SAME defect one field along, and it is why nothing about a
# report's content is refusable either. F-D26 left two refusals standing — a report with no
# `session` and a report with no text — on the reasoning that those were "about the report existing,
# not about its shape". Prod disagreed within the hour: `POST /friction` answered 400 *"session is
# required"* to a reporter who did not have one, and the report describing that very edge was itself
# thrown away. A MISSING SESSION IS SIGNAL TOO. A report we cannot tie back to a conversation is
# worth strictly more than no report, and the reporter is never the right party to be told no — it
# is us who wanted the join key, so it is us who eat its absence.
#
# THE RULE, GENERALISED, so the next field does not need a third incident: NO VALUE A CALLER CAN
# SEND PRODUCES A 400. Not a word, not a length, not an absence. Over-long values truncate, unknown
# values are kept as sent, and an absent value is stored as a genuine absence — the ref is omitted
# rather than written as `""`, and `friction_for_subject` renders it "no session" for a reader while
# keeping `session_id` empty for a grep. The only refusals
# this route still has are AUTHENTICATION (401 — the edge cannot attribute a report to nobody, and
# an unattributable report is not a poorer report but a different object) and a request that is not
# parseable at all. Note also that every argument below is typed `str`, deliberately: a non-string
# annotation would hand FastAPI a 422 one layer above this function, which is the same refusal with
# somebody else's name on it. `tests/test_friction.py` pins both properties.
#
# No migration: a report lives in `reaction.subject_refs`, which is a JSON document, so every one of
# these is a key inside it and the ten tables in `schema.sql` are untouched.
#
# EXTRAS ARE NAMESPACED, and that is not tidiness. `flows_timeline.model.concerns` decides whose
# report this is by reading `uid`/`subject`/`owner`/`organizer`/… straight off the refs, so merging
# caller-supplied keys into the top level would let a reporter file a report that reads as somebody
# else's. Under `extra` they are data; at the top level they would be authority.

    CALL THIS whenever you could not do what the person asked, or did it badly: there was no tool
    for the job, a tool refused, a page or link was missing, you landed in the wrong workspace, a
    tool said it succeeded but the thing did not happen, something errored outright, or it worked
    but was confusing. You do not need permission and you do not need to be sure it is our fault —
    file it. Nothing is too small, and a report is never lost for being imperfectly labelled.

    THE PAYLOAD IS TWO SENTENCES: `what_i_tried` (what you were attempting) and `what_happened`
    (what happened instead). Send `session` too — the chat or meeting session you are in — whenever
    you have one, because it is what ties the report back to the conversation that produced it and
    that is most of what makes it actionable later.

    NOTHING YOU SEND OR OMIT WILL COST YOU THE REPORT. There is no required field on this route: no
    session, no text, an unknown word, an over-long value — all of it is filed, stored as sent, and
    readable back. A report with no session reads as "no session" and is still a report; a missing
    join key is our problem, not yours, and it is signal in its own right. The one thing that IS
    refused is a call with no credential, because a report attributed to nobody is a different
    object rather than a poorer one. Never withhold a report because you are unsure it is
    well-formed, and never re-file one because a field felt wrong.

    `kind` is a HINT, NOT A MENU. These words group well with other people's reports:
    `missing-tool` (no tool exists for what was asked), `refusal` (a tool or policy said no),
    `no-page` (a link or page that should exist 404'd), `wrong-workspace` (the answer came from the
    wrong account or tenant), `unfulfilled` (a tool reported success and the thing did not actually
    happen), `error` (a 500, a crash, a timeout), `ux` (it worked but was confusing or awkward),
    `other`. `severity` likewise: `blocker`, `annoyance`, `papercut`, `idea`. **If none of them fits
    what you saw, use your own word** — both fields are stored exactly as you send them, and no
    word you can choose will cost you the report. Never re-file because a label felt wrong.

    ANYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW, SEND IT. Arguments this route does not name are kept with the report
    rather than dropped — a stack frame, a request id, a model name, a count. Richer is better;
    structure is somebody else's problem later.

    The subject is your own credential, same as every other person-scoped route here
    (`reactions_list`, `timeline`); an operator with no bearer may stamp `X-User-Id`, same as
    `queue_waiting`. The bare operator key, unstamped, attributes a report to nobody, refused.

# ── the queue: what is waiting for ONE PERSON (PRD decision 42.2) ─────────────────────────────
# *"what is waiting — maybe it's flows?"* (founder, 2026-09-03 07:43Z; agreed.) What is waiting is
# the set of pending reactions flows already holds for a subject — nothing is unioned at the edge,
# and no other domain contributes items. They publish EVENTS; flow definitions decide what waits.
#
# AT THE END OF THE FILE ON PURPOSE. The projection lives in `flows_queue` and this is a thin
# forward, so the whole of it fits here rather than among the routes it has nothing to do with —
# and decision 15's `auth` work lands on this same module, which a route inserted mid-file would
# collide with for no benefit.
import flows_queue as _flows_queue  # noqa: E402


# THE ONLY TEXT AN AGENT READS BEFORE DECIDING TO CALL THIS, and it says WHEN — which is the one
# thing the route's own mechanics could never say. Ten ordinary sessions with the tools loaded
# never called `whats_waiting`: they were served this route's implementation notes, and a tool
# described by its implementation reads as something for somebody else. Header precedence and
# status codes answer "how do I call it correctly", a question an agent that never calls it does
# not have.
#
# IT IS A `summary`, AND THE ROUTE CARRIES NO DOCSTRING ON PURPOSE. The MCP edge derives a tool's
# description from this route's OpenAPI operation, preferring the docstring and falling back to
# the summary (`core/meetings/services/mcp/src/vexa_mcp/bind.py::_describe`). A docstring here
# would therefore be served to every agent, in front of every call, forever. The maintainer's
# half lives in the comment block below instead, where no agent pays for it by the token.
WHATS_WAITING_SUMMARY = (
    "What your person's Vexa needs right now — call it at the start of a session, after "
    "connecting, and whenever they mention a meeting; each item's `say` is what to tell them. "
    "Returns the queue for the authenticated caller.")

# ── how this route resolves its subject (maintainer's half; deliberately not agent-facing) ─────
#
# THE SUBJECT IS THE AUTHENTICATED CALLER'S, and there are two ways to be one.
#
# A PERSON authenticates with their own Vexa credential and their subject is resolved from it
# (issue #1468). Nothing they send can move it: a `subject` argument naming anyone else is 403,
# and an `X-User-Id` header is ignored outright. That header is a string a caller can type, and
# it is only ever evidence because the OPERATOR key gates it — a service vouching for a person it
# resolved. A verified credential is stronger evidence than any header, so it wins.
#
# THE OPERATOR reads one person's queue on their behalf, and keeps exactly the behaviour this
# route shipped with: `X-User-Id` is the gateway's answer and outranks `?subject=`, and
# `?subject=` is the unstamped console read. Neither ever answers with the instance — no subject
# at all is a 400, because this route answers for ONE person or for nobody.
#
# The distinction matters because this route is NOT always behind the gateway: reached through
# the MCP edge it is addressed directly, and that edge stamps no `X-User-Id` at all — it forwards
# the caller's own credential, which is the whole reason a person's credential has to open the
# door here.
#
# Not opened by `VEXA_FLOWS_TIMELINE_KEY`: that key is documented as opening the timeline and
# nothing else, and quietly widening a key's reach is how a narrow credential stops being narrow.
#
# The answer is DATA plus behavior's words: every sentence a person hears is resolved from
# `behavior/queue/`, read hot, never from this body. See `flows_queue` for why silence there is
# the filter rather than a keyword list here.

    A standing notice is something that stays true BETWEEN calls rather than something that just
    happened, so a caller is meant to read it alongside whatever it was already doing rather than
    go looking for it. That is why this answer is the smallest one this surface has: a list of
    sentences, no reaction ids, no flow names, no steps, no typed reasons — cheap enough to ask on
    every call. A caller that wants any of those wants `GET /queue/waiting`.

    WHICH ITEMS ARE NOTICES IS BEHAVIOR'S TO DECIDE, not this route's and not any caller's: a
    say-file under `behavior/queue/` opens with `notice: true` in its front-matter, or it does not.
    That is an admin's file and an admin's edit with no deploy on either side of it — the same file
    and the same edit that already decide whether an item is spoken at all (`flows_queue`,
    `behavior/queue/README.md`). No word of any notice is written here or anywhere in this image.

    Same door as `GET /queue/waiting`, in every particular: a person is resolved from their own
    credential and cannot name anyone else, an operator passes `?subject=` or the gateway stamps
    `X-User-Id`, and no subject at all is a 400 because this route answers for ONE person.

# THE ENTRYPOINT GUARD IS THE LAST THING IN THIS MODULE, and that is load-bearing rather than

# the compose command, the helm command, the rig's command — runs this file AS `__main__`: the
# guard fires, `main()` blocks inside `uvicorn.run`, and NOTHING BELOW IT IS EVER EXECUTED. So the
# process that every deployment actually runs served /flows, /events and /health and answered 404
# on `/.well-known/mcp-tools.json`, while the offline suite — which IMPORTS the module, where
# `__name__` is not `__main__` and the whole file runs — proved the route existed and served the
# right four tools. Green offline, absent live, and only the first live boot of the compose service
# could tell them apart.
#
# Anything added after this line is invisible to the running service. Add routes ABOVE it.
