"""THE CONFIG CONTRACT for `core/flows` — every environment key this brick reads, declared once.

`gate:config-contract` covers five adopted services and `core/flows` is not one of them (seam
backlog B7/B9: "the config-contract gate is green over less than half the seam"). Adopting flows
into `config.v1` is that structural item and it is not this file. What this file IS, is the thing
that makes the adoption mechanical when it happens, and that closes the hole in the meantime: ONE
table of every key, both directions asserted by a test — nothing read that is not declared, and
nothing declared that is not read.

Both directions matter and only one of them is the usual one. `read ⊆ declared` catches the key
somebody added in a hurry; `declared ⊆ read` catches the key whose reader was deleted — the shape
that leaves an operator setting a value that reaches nothing (R-E18: three `VEXA_LLM_*` keys
advertised, read by the runner, forwarded by no dispatch).

Three classes, the same three the `config.v1` contract uses, so the adoption is a transcription:

  required-explicit  unset or empty ⇒ the process refuses to start. `default` is None.
  defaulted          the documented code default applies; the default lives HERE, next to the why.
  capability         the key belongs to a feature that is simply off when it is unset.

Reading a key through `get`/`get_int`/`get_bool`/`domains` is what makes the declaration binding:
the accessors refuse a name that is not in the table, so a typo is a crash at the read rather than
a silent empty string. The historical constants in `flows_steps/common.py`,
`flows_integrations/inbox.py` and friends still read `os.environ` directly — they are declared
here and the test proves it; converting them is hygiene, not security, and it is not this branch.
