    """Fire an agent turn; returns the history length BEFORE it (the collect baseline).
    /api/chat is an SSE STREAM that stays open for the whole turn — a client timeout while
    the stream runs is SUCCESS, not failure (the double-dispatch bug of 2026-08-23 evening).

    ``room`` opens THE MEETING ROOM: the post-meeting widening in which this turn may read the
    DESKS of the people who were in the meeting. Four fields go on the post, and the split between
    them is the whole safety property:

      ``meeting_id``      -> ``room_meeting_id``. The caller names ONLY THE MEETING, never a
                             workspace — a caller who could name workspaces could read anybody's
                             desk by naming it. Must be the meetings-domain ROW id.
      ``read``            -> ``room_participants``: the invite's ADDRESSES, in priority order. agent-api
                             resolves each through admin-api and mounts only those that already
                             have a subject AND a desk. **Addresses, not subject ids**: this side
                             deliberately does not resolve identity, so it cannot mint a ghost
                             account, and a person who is not a user is simply skipped there.
      ``names``           -> ``room_participant_names``: address -> the invite's ``CN=`` display name,
                             so the far side never has to guess a person from an email local part.
      ``read_max``        -> ``room_read_max``: the flow's cap, clamped to a server ceiling.

    THE INTERNAL-TIER HEADER IS PART OF THE ROOM, NOT AN EXTRA. agent-api refuses a room to any
    caller that cannot present ``X-Internal-Secret``, so it goes on the same post. Its value comes
    from the environment (``INTERNAL_API_SECRET``, a mode-600 file the lane's start script
    exports) and never from this repository; both entrypoints refuse to start without it, so by
    the time a turn is dispatched it exists.

    Omitted entirely when there is no room, so every other dispatch in this file sends exactly the
    body it has always sent.

    WHAT IS AND IS NOT "THE TURN IS RUNNING" (P21b). This used to be `except Exception: pass`, with
    the comment above as its whole justification — and the comment is right about ONE exception and
    wrong about every other. A client timeout while the SSE stream is open really does mean the
    turn started: that is the 2026-08-23 double-dispatch lesson and it is preserved exactly. A
    connection refused, a DNS failure, a 401, a 404, a 500 mean the opposite — nothing is running —
    and swallowing them returned a baseline as though a turn had been dispatched, after which
    `collect_reply` waited for a reply that was never coming, for as long as its caller allowed.
    A dispatch that did not happen, reported as one that did, is the exact shape P21 names.

    So: the status is checked, and only a TIMEOUT is treated as success."""
