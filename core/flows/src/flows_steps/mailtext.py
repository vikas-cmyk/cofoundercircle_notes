"""mailtext.py — the WORDS this deployment mails, as files a human edits, not strings in a step.

Founder, 2026-09-02, on the mails a stranger sees first: the wording is his and he will rewrite it.
That sentence is a requirement about the SOFTWARE, not about the copy: if his rewrite means
touching a Python string, it means a review, a rebuild and a deploy, and it will not happen at the
speed a first impression needs to be fixed at. So every mail body this deployment sends lives in a
file, and a rewrite is a file edit.

The shape is the one the PRD already names (§3.1/§3.2, "baked default, data override") and that the
deeplink presets already ship in:

    baked default (this file)  ->  `_global/mail/<name>.md` overrides it  ->  read hot, per send

`_global` is git-backed, admin-only-writable and mounted into every worker, so an override is a
reviewable commit rather than a silent mutation, and nothing is rebuilt when it changes.

TWO HALVES OF THE INTRODUCTION, AND ONLY ONE IS EDITABLE. The company half — who this Vexa belongs
to — is read from `_global/README.md`, which the admin wrote during instance setup. The service
half is FIXED PRODUCT TEXT: what Vexa does is not a per-deployment opinion, and a company that
edits it into something Vexa does not do has written a promise the product will break.

# The fixed half. Not admin-editable, deliberately. The same sentence is in the MCP instructions
# so the chat and the mail introduce the product identically -- a person who reads one and then
# the other must not meet two different products.

# THE USER-FACING NAME of a person's own workspace. Founder, 2026-09-02: it is a **DESK** — a
# personal desk, and a group desk for a group. Not a placeholder any more; the word is chosen.
# Change it HERE and every mail this runtime sends follows. Code paths, slugs and API fields keep
# saying "workspace" deliberately — renaming those is a migration, and a migration is not what a
# naming decision should cost.
#
# The word carries the meaning the founder attached to it, and it is the reason "private" was the
# wrong word: a desk is COMPANY KNOWLEDGE HELD BY ONE PERSON. The company's agents may read it for a
# meeting that person is in. `_system` — chats, sessions, settings — stays private and is not a desk.
#
# The terminal has the same constant on its side (clients/terminal/src/minutes/vocabulary.ts) and
# fills `{{workspace}}` in the presets from it; the two runtimes cannot share a literal, so they
# name each other. Those two lines are the whole rename.
#
# Note what does NOT use it: the visibility sentence below says "workspaces", the ordinary English
# word, not the product's name for one — it is describing where things are kept, not naming a
# surface, and a stranger reading their first mail should not have to learn a product noun to
# understand who can see their notes.

# WHO CAN SEE WHAT, in the founder's own words. It goes into the mails a person reads before they
# have decided whether to keep anything here, because that is the only moment at which telling them
# is a choice they still have. Not a disclaimer and not a legal line: three facts.

    # BYTE-FOR-BYTE `behavior/mail/attendee-head.md`, and it has to stay that way: the README
    # in that directory says the source and the baked default are the same content or the source

    # must not become a token that a deployment could leave unfilled: it is the sentence that tells

    # fallback that quietly drops it discloses nothing. Change any of the three and you change
