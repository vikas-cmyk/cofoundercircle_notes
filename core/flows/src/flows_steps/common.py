#: ("fronting a sibling's door with the edge does not make it not-an-edge") and it is a separate
#: change with its own consequences, measured and stated on this PR: the gateway resolves the
#: caller's key and enriches every forward with X-User-Id, X-User-Scopes, X-User-Workspaces and
#: X-User-Limits — and `POST /bots` enforces the per-user concurrent-bot cap out of that last one
#: (`meeting_api/bot_spawn/router.py:208` `_resolve_max_concurrent`). Calling meeting-api directly
#: without carrying those forward would silently drop the cap, so the de-hop is not a rename.

    turned off, one that fails CLOSED is a person who silently stops receiving their minutes"*.
    Both of those are true, and both are answers to the wrong question — a transport error is not
    a fact about what somebody prefers, and neither direction had to be picked. The third option is
    to not answer yet: a reaction that retries in ten minutes mails nothing wrong now and mails the
    right thing later, which is what `retryable` is for.

    It mattered more than a single wrong mail, because the answer was then CACHED: one refused
    connection during a rolling restart pinned that person to defaults for the life of the worker,
    with the identity row saying something else the whole time.
