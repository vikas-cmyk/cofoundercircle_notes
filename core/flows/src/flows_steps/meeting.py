      all-hands does not hand the run fifty desks.

    **A failed match degrades to invite order, NEVER to an empty room.** No transcript, no

    loss of the whole feature, and it would look exactly like a meeting where nobody spoke.

    and the step goes on to poll for a `stopping` that will never arrive — a bot that will not
    leave a call records unboundedly and surfaces nowhere.

    404/409 ARE SUCCESS HERE. A stop is idempotent and both of those mean the bot is already gone
    (a retry after a partial run, or the platform's own reaper got there first) — treating them as
    failures would escalate the one case that is already the outcome we want.

    Anything else is counted in the reaction's durable scratch, so the count survives the worker:
    once, the platform may be restarting; `STOP_ATTEMPTS_MAX` times running is a fact about this
    meeting, and the caller escalates."""
