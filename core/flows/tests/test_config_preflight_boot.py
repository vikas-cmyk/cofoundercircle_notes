"""THE VENDORED CONFIG VALIDATOR IS ACTUALLY CALLED — review E6 (P14/P9, ADR-0026).

`core/flows/src/config_preflight.py` is byte-identical to `deploy/contracts/config.v1/preflight.py`
and gate-checked as such, and until this change NOTHING under `core/flows/src` imported it: the
validator every adopted service runs at boot was dead code in the one service that declares 35
keys. The sibling MCP does call it (`vexa_mcp/app.py`: `from .config_preflight import preflight;
preflight()`).

What flows checked instead was `flows_config.preflight()` over `DOOR_KEYS` — a different and much
narrower question (can this deployment NAME its doors), which is flows' own rule and is not in the
declaration. Both now run, in both entrypoints.

THE DRIFT THAT PROVES IT MATTERED: the declaration forbids SEVEN placeholder literals per secret
key; `flows_api.py` carried its own hand-typed list of FOUR. So `VEXA_FLOWS_API_KEY` set to
`vexa-internal-secret` — a literal published in this repository, therefore not a secret, presentable
by anyone who can read the source — booted green. And `VEXA_FLOWS_TIMELINE_KEY` declared no
forbidden values at all and was silently coerced to `""`, which reads as prudent and is not: the
operator got no error and no effect.
