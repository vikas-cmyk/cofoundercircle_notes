"""The attendee mail's SHAPE: one template HEAD + ONE shared report, the same words to everybody.

Four elements, in order, and nothing else: head → the shared report → one gap line → one button.
The gap line and the button belong to `notify.compose`, so every assertion here reads the `link`
off the recorded call rather than hunting for a url in prose.

Four properties this file exists to hold:

  1. THERE IS ONE MAIL READER, AND IT IS `mailtext`. The live text a send reads is
     `_global/mail/<name>.md` — admin-writable, git-backed, mounted into every worker — falling
     back to the identical baked default in `flows_steps/mailtext.py`. This step used to run a
     SECOND reader of its own against the repo path `behavior/mail/`, which is not what a
     send reads: an admin's live edit was ignored, and because that reader did not parse the
     `subject:` / `---` header the body it mailed began with the literal line `subject: … ---`.
  2. THE SUBJECT COMES OUT OF THE SAME RENDER as the body. It used to be a Python f-string, so
     editing the template could not change it.
  3. ONE REPORT, THE SAME MAIL TO EVERYONE (founder, 2026-09-02). No per-person section, no
     `## _decision`, no silent policy, no room-size cap — and therefore nothing that can hand two
     people in one room different words. Personalisation happens in the chat after the click.
  4. THE SOURCE FILE AND THE BAKED DEFAULT ARE THE SAME BYTES. `behavior/mail/README.md`
     says they are, so a drift gate is the only thing that makes that true rather than intended.

THE KICK IS NOT HERE. `process_meeting`'s prompt to `ag.dispatch_turn` is agent surface, and the
no-agents product (decision 40.6) composes no kick at all — so those two tests live in the sibling
`test_attendee_kick_text.py`, and everything below holds with the agent domain absent.

No network, no clock, no DB: the step is called directly with the refs its flow would hand it.
