    the right behaviour for a deployment and it makes every offline test that touches a step
    raise on the refusal instead of on the thing it is testing — so the suite declares a key,
    exactly as the lane's start script does, and the tests that are ABOUT the refusal unset it
    themselves (`test_admin_key_refusal.py`).

    `setdefault` semantics on purpose: a run that already exports a real key — the live contract
    smoke against a running admin-api — keeps it.

#: localhost: the whole point of the change that made these required is that a host-port default
#: silently addresses whatever else is listening — on 2026-09-03 a bare `pytest` run of
#: `test_admin_user_lookup_shapes` reached `vexa-v012`'s admin-api through the old
#: `http://localhost:18057` default and read its 403 as this stack's answer. A test that wants a
#: LIVE service exports the real URL (the contract smoke does, and skips when it is absent); every
#: offline test gets an address that is unmistakably not a service, so a step that tries to reach
#: one fails loudly instead of hitting a neighbour.

    # A `.invalid` hostname would be tidier to read and worse to run: it costs a DNS lookup that
    # fails as a different error class, so an offline test would diverge from a real refusal.
