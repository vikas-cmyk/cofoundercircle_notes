"""F94 — an account was created for a timestamp, and neither lock existed.

On 2026-09-02 the instance gained user 131 with the email `20260902t183213z`. It is the DTSTAMP of
the first rehearsal invite, five seconds after the invite landed. The chain:

    ICS UID contains "organizer"  →  parse_ics matched the word inside the UID line and captured
                                     the next colon's value (the DTSTAMP)
    invite_intake.ensure_user     →  created a platform account for that string

Three fixes, and they are at three different depths:

  * the CAUSE — `parse_ics` anchors its property patterns (`core/flows/tests/test_ics_property_anchor.py`)
  * the LAST PLACE THAT CAN TELL — `ensure_user` refuses a non-address, here
  * the REHEARSAL'S OWN GUARD — `guard_domain` checks the shape, not just the suffix
    (`deploy/dogfood/rehearse/tests/test_guards.py`)

The middle one matters most: everything after `ensure_user` works with a uid and has no way to
know the account behind it came from a parse artefact.
