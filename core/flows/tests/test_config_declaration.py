"""THE CONFIG CONTRACT, both directions — nothing read that is not declared, nothing declared that
is not read.

The rate limits this branch adds are configuration, and configuration that lives only in the code
that reads it is how `gate:config-contract` came to be green over less than half the seam (B7):
81 literal env reads outside every scan list, no declared→read direction, and one key plumbed
through four surfaces and consumed by nothing (R-E18). `core/flows` is not one of the five adopted
`config.v1` services and adopting it is that structural item, not this branch — so this file is
the same assertion at this brick's own scale, which is what makes the adoption a transcription
when it happens.

Both directions, and only one of them is the usual one:

  read ⊆ declared   catches the key somebody added in a hurry — the 18 that R-A11 found;
  declared ⊆ read   catches the key whose READER was deleted, which is the shape that leaves an
                    operator setting a value that reaches nothing and never says so.
