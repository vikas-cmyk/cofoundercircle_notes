"""flows-api as a COMPOSE SERVICE — the three things that stopped it being one.

Today the flows lanes run on the host out of `~/.storm/flows-up.sh`, on loopback :18200/:18201, and
the compose-network `mcp` service reaches them through an interim hack: the lane is bound to the
docker bridge address so the assembler can fetch `/.well-known/mcp-tools.json`. That interim is a
host-specific address written into a deployment, and it is what a real service replaces.

Three gaps, and each is small enough to look like nothing:

  * `main()` binds `127.0.0.1`. Inside a container that is the loopback of the container, so the
    service is unreachable from every other service on the network — the single reason the bridge
    address had to be hand-wired.
  * there is no `/health`, so nothing can express a compose `healthcheck` or a `depends_on`
    condition against it.
  * the manifest route exists but nothing pins WHICH tools it serves, so an assembly that silently
    lost a tool would still look assembled.

Offline, genuinely (2026-09-03): the engine is stdlib-pure and `postgres_db` builds its engine
lazily — connects on first use, applies the schema on first real `execute`/`executescript` — so
the app imports and answers `/health` against an UNREACHABLE Postgres DSN below, no database
running anywhere. This file is the direct proof of that gap-closer: it used to compose against
`sqlite://` (a different adapter standing in), which meant "builds without a database" was
never actually exercised for the Postgres path this service ships on.

# IMPORTING THIS APP HAS SIDE EFFECTS, so every one of them is undone before the module finishes.
#
# `flows_api` reads its credentials and composes its database AT IMPORT. Getting it in here means
# setting environment, PROCESS-WIDE. Left in place it leaks into every other test file in the
# session, which is not hypothetical: the first version of this module turned
# `test_link_loop.py::test_mint_scaffold_posts_the_record_and_returns_the_url` red, and that test
# passes on its own. `gate:test-isolation` exists for this shape.
#
# THE DATABASE IS CHOSEN BY THE URL, not by a monkeypatch. An earlier version of this file swapped
# `flows.postgres_db` for an in-memory sqlite adapter; `flows_api` then moved to `db_from_url`,
# which resolves `postgres_db` inside `flows.db` and never saw the swap, so the module tried to
# open a real connection at import. Postgres is now the ONLY dialect `db_from_url` accepts
# (2026-09-03 — the old `sqlite://` branch moved a TEST double, `SqliteDB`, into
# `tests/sqlite_double.py`, and `db_from_url` refuses anything that does not name Postgres), so
# this suite is a deployment whose URL names Postgres and is simply UNREACHABLE — laziness, not a
# different adapter, is what lets the import succeed.
