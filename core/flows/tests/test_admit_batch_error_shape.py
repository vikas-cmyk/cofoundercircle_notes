"""POST /events/batch never echoes an exception's message to the admin caller — CodeQL
py/stack-trace-exposure, alert #252 on PR #1456 (`core/flows/src/flows_integrations/flows_api.py`,
the `except Exception as e` in `admit_batch`).

Before the fix, one bad row's `error` field was `f"{type(e).__name__}: {e}"[:200]` — `str(e)` is
whatever the failing driver or the failing row put in the exception's message, and there is no
class of exception this route can guarantee is safe to echo: a DB driver's `OperationalError`
carries the DSN it tried, a validation error can carry another row's field value. The response goes
to an admin caller over the network, not to a log.

OFFLINE, same shape as `test_health.py` and `test_subject_bearer.py`: `flows_api` reads its
credentials and builds its app at import, so they are set immediately before the import and
restored immediately after — process-wide poison otherwise, whichever test module imports first.

UNREACHABLE Postgres DSN, not `sqlite://` (merge-time fix, #1504 landing after this test was
written): `db_from_url` now refuses any non-Postgres scheme outright (`flows.db.UnsupportedDialect`)
and `SqliteDB` moved to `tests/sqlite_double.py` as a test double, so `sqlite://` fails at import.
Postgres construction stays lazy (`postgres_db()` only connects/applies schema on first use — see
`tests/test_queue_waiting.py`'s `api` fixture for the same pattern) and `admit` is monkeypatched to
`_boom` below, so this module never touches a real database either way.
