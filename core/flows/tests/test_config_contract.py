"""config.v1 (ADR-0026) — `core/flows` adopted, and the two declarations held together.

Flows carried its OWN declaration long before this: `flows_config.DECLARED`, written to make the
adoption "a transcription when it happens" (its own docstring), with both directions asserted by
`test_config_declaration.py`. The adoption did not replace that table — the accessors
(`get`/`get_int`/`get_bool`) still refuse an undeclared name at the read, which is a thing a JSON
file cannot do — so the brick now has TWO declarations of the same fact, and two declarations of
one fact drift. That is exactly the shape F95 was (one secret, three names, three refusal lists).

So the file that would have been "the declaration conforms to the schema" is instead "the two
declarations are the same declaration", plus the boot-behaviour assertions the contract's shared
validator makes possible. Schema conformance itself is `gate:config-contract` check 1 and the
contract's own `validate.mjs`; it is not restated here.

WHAT THE SHARED PREFLIGHT IS AND IS NOT WIRED TO. `config_preflight.py` is vendored verbatim (the
gate enforces byte-equality) and is what makes the declaration machine-readable — capability
tri-states, forbidden-value refusals, `/health` rows. The flows entrypoints still call
`flows_config.preflight()`, which is door-scoped and older; putting a second boot validator in
front of a running deployment is a change to how it boots and belongs to whoever is changing that,
not to the adoption. Offline, stdlib only.
