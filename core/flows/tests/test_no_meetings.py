"""PRD decision 40.7 and decision 5 — flows runs with the meetings domain absent, and says so.

*"We want agents service be optional, all domains must work independently and in any
configuration… meetings, agents and flows — independently and together in any configuration."*
(founder, 2026-09-03 07:47Z.) #1453 delivered the agent half. This is meetings.

WHAT IT IS NOT, and the distinction is the whole design (#1453's own rule, restated because this
file is where it would be lost): presence is a CONFIGURATION FACT, never a probe. A health check
makes *"meeting-api is restarting"* and *"there is no meeting-api"* the same answer, and only the
second is a supported product — the first is an outage that must retry. **A meeting service that
is DOWN keeps the retry path it has today.** Nothing here touches it.

The shape being removed is two defects deep:

  * `VEXA_FLOWS_GATEWAY_URL` was `required-explicit`, so a flows deployment with no meetings
    REFUSED TO BOOT — `preflight()` names the door and exits, before anything about meetings is
    asked;
  * and `flows_steps/meeting.py` bound the door AT IMPORT, so even a process that got past the
    preflight could not import its own step vocabulary.

Neither is a degrade. A domain that is optional has to be absent-able at boot, at import, and at
the step — and this file is the contract for all three.
