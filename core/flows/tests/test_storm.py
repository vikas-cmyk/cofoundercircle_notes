"""THE STORM — adversarial, randomized runs against the engine in full isolation.

Each round builds a fresh rig, admits a fleet of events (with duplicate deliveries), then drives
N logical workers whose every tick may be struck by: injected step faults, crashes AFTER the
effect, worker death mid-lease (simulated by claiming and abandoning), random reconciler timing,
random meeting completions, random operator cancel/retry, and time jumps. After the chaos budget
is spent it drains to quiescence and asserts the INVARIANTS — the things that must hold under any
interleaving:

  I1  one reaction per (event, flow) — duplicates created nothing
  I2  every effect exactly once per target: meetings, bots, commits, per-recipient emails
  I3  no summary email exists without its commit (order held under every crash)
  I4  terminal states only: done / failed / cancelled — nothing leased, nothing forgotten
  I5  every failed reaction carries a reason (typed failure, not a mystery)
  I6  operator retry after the storm converges the failed to done — with still-exactly-once effects

Seeds are printed on failure: `STORM_SEED=n pytest tests/test_storm.py` reproduces a run exactly.
