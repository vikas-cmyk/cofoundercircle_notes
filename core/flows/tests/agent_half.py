"""IS THE AGENT HALF OF THE PRODUCTION DEFINITIONS IN THIS TREE?

`flows_defs/production_agent.py` is OPTIONAL BY CONSTRUCTION, and `production._register_agent_flows`
says so in the product code: it checks `importlib.util.find_spec` before importing, *"so a cut that
deletes `production_agent.py` outright leaves this module registering the three flows it keeps
rather than failing to import"*. A cut that omits the agent half is a supported tree, and
`flows_defs/README.md` names the four flows that live there — `meeting_prep`, `email_chat`,
`desk_setup`, `desk_claim`.

**The suite has to be honest on BOTH trees, and that is not the same as passing on both.** Before
this module, fourteen tests asserted on steps and flows that only the full tree registers; on the
cut tree they failed, and the whole suite went red for a reason that is not a defect. The two wrong
ways out are equally bad: deleting the assertions loses the contract on the tree that HAS the agent
half, and loosening them (`>=` instead of `==`, a `try/except`) turns a real regression into a
silent pass. So the assertions stay exactly as strict as they were, and the ones that cannot mean
anything without the module are SKIPPED BY PRESENCE, with the reason on the skip.

The presence signal is the one the product itself uses — `find_spec`, never an import attempt:
a missing optional module is a fact about the tree, a broken one is a defect, and `except
ImportError` cannot tell them apart.

Usage:

    import agent_half

    @agent_half.required
    def test_something_about_prepare_meeting(): ...

    EXPECTED = CORE_STEPS | (AGENT_HALF_STEPS if agent_half.PRESENT else set())
