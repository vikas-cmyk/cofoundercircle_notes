"""THE ONBOARDING FLOW — a new person's first step, as a queue row.

Founder, 2026-09-04: *"whats_waiting — that's the one agent must call after got installed and that
one will prompt them to try a meeting"* · *"we want them to try a meeting so they are activated.
Activated meaning 1 meeting with transcription"*.

Every test here is about one of the two things that can silently be wrong: WHO the row is about
(a scoping bug returns somebody else's meeting and clears the item for a person who has done
nothing), and WHAT counts as done (a completion with no transcript clears the item on the one run
that proved least).
