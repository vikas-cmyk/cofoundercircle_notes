"""The link loop: a flow-sent notification carries a COMPOSED terminal deeplink.

Two properties, and they are different. (1) The recipes no longer name a transport — every send
goes through the notify PORT, so a fake channel installed here sees all of them and no SMTP
connection is attempted. (2) The two meeting mails carry exactly one link each, built from
VEXA_UI_URL, naming the preset and the meeting: `?ask=minutes-review&meeting=<row-id>` after,
`?ask=prep&meeting=<ref>` before.

No network, no clock, no DB — the steps are called directly with the refs their flow would have
handed them, which is also the only way to exercise prepare_meeting without a real invite."""
