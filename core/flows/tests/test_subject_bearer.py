"""A PERSON'S OWN CREDENTIAL, on the routes that are about that person — issue #1468.

Every route on this service used to take one deployment-wide operator key, and that key is not a
person: with it `GET /reactions` returns every reaction in the instance and
`POST /reactions/{id}/cancel` cancels any of them. So the MCP edge, which forwards the CALLER's own
credential and holds none of its own, could be wired two ways and both were wrong — refuse the
person (what it did: a 401 arriving inside a JSON-RPC envelope), or hand them the instance.

This is the third way. The subject-scoped routes accept the person's own Vexa credential, resolve
who that is through identity's `/internal/validate` — the one resolver, the same one the gateway
asks — and scope on the answer. The admin routes are untouched.

OFFLINE. `flows_api` builds its app at import and refuses to start without its credentials, so they
are supplied here before the import exactly as `test_health.py` does, with the SAME literals: the
module captures them as constants at import, and whichever test module imports first wins.

The identity hop is stubbed at its lowest seam — `subject_auth._validate`, the one HTTP call — so
the mapping from what identity answers to what this service answers is what is under test, and not
a mock of the answer we wanted.
