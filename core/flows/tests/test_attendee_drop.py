"""THE DROP: the meeting's artefact onto every desk in the room, written by plain code.

Founder decision 22, 2026-09-02. `process_meeting` writes into NO desk — not the organiser's
either — and the note's canonical home is the meeting row and its transcript store. So this step
is where a meeting lands on a person: it copies the one artefact, byte-for-byte, to everybody who
was in the room, organiser included, nobody special. No agent turn, no LLM.

Six properties this file exists to hold:

  1. THE ENTITY IS THE ARTEFACT, not a pointer to somebody else's copy of it. There is no longer a
     copy elsewhere to point at.
  2. THE SAME BYTES FOR EVERYONE except the last line — the `?meeting=` link, which carries that
     person's own share token because a forwarded link must grant its new reader nothing.
  3. THE ORGANISER IS IN THE ROOM. Their copy is the same entity, with the token-free link
     `email_minutes` already built.
  4. THE INDEX is created, then appended — once. A re-run adds no second line.
  5. IDEMPOTENT ACROSS RUNS, not merely within one.
  6. ONE FAILURE NEVER COSTS THE OTHERS THEIRS. The step fails only when EVERY drop failed.

No network: `ensure_platform_user`, `workspace_init`, `workspace_write` and `ws_file` are replaced
by a fake desk store that records exactly what would have been written.
