"""PRD decision 42.2 — what is waiting IS flows, and a live call is a reaction like any other.

*"what is waiting — maybe it's flows?"* (founder, 2026-09-03 07:43Z; agreed.)

The queue a person's own agent reads used to be assembled at the edge from four sources — flows
reactions, the gateway's `/bots/status`, agent-api workspace files and a local friction log — with
two hundred lines of product copy in the tool body. Two of those four are agent-api reads, so the
verb could not ship in the `no-agents` product at all.

This file is the contract for the replacement, in the order the issue's acceptance table states it:

  A1  a finished meeting's reaction is in the queue — and NOTHING is, before the meeting finished
  A2  a live call is a pending reaction, and it is not in anybody else's queue
  A3  with the agent domain absent the queue still answers, and says which domain was absent
  A4  the subject is the authenticated caller's — a stamped identity beats a query argument
  A5  every item traces to a reaction id: the route cannot invent a row (the dropped friction ask)

Offline like the rest of the suite: real sqlite rows written the way the engine writes them, the
production definitions built against them, and — for A4 — the real app through `TestClient`, the
composition `tests/test_health.py` already uses.

    cheaper to be wrong, and it is the check that would have caught it.
