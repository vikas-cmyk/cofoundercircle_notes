"""The instance gate: a Vexa with no company layer must not act on the world.

Three things are under test and they are deliberately separate concerns:

  1. `flows_integrations/instance_gate.py` — the single reader. Fail-closed on every error path,
     cached so `tick` cannot poll admin-api to death, logged on TRANSITION so an operator can tell
     "admin-api is down" from "the admin has not finished setup".
  2. `flows/loop.py` — PARK, never drop. A closed gate must leave every reaction byte-identical:
     same status, same step, same attempt, same next_run_at. A parked fact that retried itself
     into `failed` would be a dropped fact, just slower.
  3. `flows_integrations/flows_api.py` — intakes admit and SAY they parked; the two operator verbs
     refuse; reads stay open. Asserted against the source rather than imported: importing that
     module still mints an API key and needs its own credential + DB-URL env at import time
     (`postgres_db` is lazy since 2026-09-03, so it no longer needs a reachable Postgres — but the
     env dance is process-wide poison for every OTHER test file in the session, exactly the shape
     `gate:test-isolation` exists for, which is why no other test in this suite imports it either).

No network, no admin-api, no clock, no Postgres — the HTTP read is replaced at the seam and the
engine half runs on the sqlite fixture.
