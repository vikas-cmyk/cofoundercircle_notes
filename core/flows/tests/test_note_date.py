"""Two occurrences of ONE recurring meeting, processed the same day, must be two notes.

The note path is ``kg/entities/meeting/<stamp>-<title-slug>.md`` and ``stamp`` used to be
``time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`` — the PROCESSING day. A recurring meeting keeps one
``native_meeting_id`` AND one title across occurrences, so two of them written on the same day
landed on the same path: the second silently overwrote the first. Replay makes this the normal
case: ten recorded meetings replayed this afternoon are ten occurrences processed today.

WHAT THESE TESTS NOW CALL, and why it changed (2026-09-02). They used to dispatch a whole
``process_meeting`` turn and fish the path back out of the PROMPT. That worked only while the
kick named a path — and it meant the assertions pinned the KICK's spelling of it, which had
silently drifted from the WRITER's: the kick said ``<stamp>-<native>.md``, ``drop_to_attendees``
wrote ``<day>-<slug>.md``, and the terminal opened ``<native>.md``. Three spellings of one path,
none of them agreeing, and every test green. They now call ``_note_path`` — the single recipe
both the writer and the scaffold read — so a drift like that cannot be invisible again.
