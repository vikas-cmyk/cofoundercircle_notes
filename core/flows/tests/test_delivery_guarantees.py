"""DELIVERY: the report goes out ONCE, to EVERYONE, and we know when it did not.

Seven findings of the 2026-09-02 line-vs-main review sit under one sentence, and each breaks a
different clause of it:

  ONCE      R-B01  the attendee fan-out can outlive its 90 s lease, which has no renewal; the
                   reclaiming worker restarts from an empty scratch, so a 20-person room is mailed
                   twice, with two share tokens each.
  EVERYONE  R-B20  the desk drop builds its room from `email_attendees`' `drops`, which is empty
                   whenever the MAIL was switched off or every attendee is cross-domain — a guard
                   on the mail door closing the desk door.
            R-B23  a per-attendee send failure loses that person the mail permanently: the address
                   enters neither `sent` nor `drops`, and nothing ever retries it.
            R-B07  a backslash in the meeting title raises inside `re.sub`'s REPLACEMENT, so the
                   whole fan-out for that room dies and retries into the same error forever.
  WE KNOW   R-B03  claimed `MAX_ATTEMPTS` is unreachable for a step mixing `Wait` and `StepError`.
                   IT IS NOT — the two tests under that heading are the evidence, and they PASS on
                   the code the review read. A `Wait` is +1 (claim) then -1 (the Wait branch), so
                   it is net zero; only an error-ending claim keeps its increment, and `attempt`
                   therefore climbs by exactly one per `StepError`. Observed at `_retry_or_fail`
                   for a step polling three times per dispatch: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 — backoff 5 s,
                   30 s, 120 s, 600 s, 600 s, 600 s — then `failed`. The tests stay as pins.
            R-B26  nothing ever wrote `effect_receipt.state = 'failed'`, so a permanently failed
                   `email_minutes` renders as `in_flight` and the timeline module's own promise —
                   "the one thing an agent must not do is talk about a report it never delivered"
                   — is not kept.
            R-B18  the prompt "hot reload" did not exist. `prompt_for` read the flow's `prompts`
                   param and nothing else, while this file asserted three screens down that it
                   "reads a live `_global` override before the baked file" and the decision-22
                   detector told the operator to go and check that override when it fired — a path
                   the code never opened.
            R-B21  the note path is stamped at three moments with a wall-clock fallback, so the
                   mail's path and the desk's path differ by minutes and the Minutes tab reads
                   "No page here yet". This is F58 re-opening on a second route.

No network, no sleeps: the engine tests run on the sqlite rig, the step tests call the step
directly with the refs its flow would hand it.
