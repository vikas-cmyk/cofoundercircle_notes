# core/flows — the reaction engine

Durable product workflows as TWO Postgres tables and ONE leased worker loop. A fact enters as a
sealed envelope, becomes exactly one `reaction` row (dedup by constraint), is worked one step at a
time, and every touch of the outside world leaves an `effect_receipt` a retry consults before acting.

- **ADR:** the reaction table with receipts IS the engine; Dapr is a possible future executor of the
  same steps, never the foundation. Full design: docs/WORKFLOW-ARCHITECTURE-PRD.md + the published
  architecture page.
- **Isolation:** `src/flows/` (the engine) imports stdlib only at module scope — no meetings, no
  agent, no runtime, no third-party. Step implementations (`src/flows_steps/`) and flow definitions
  (`src/flows_defs/`) sit OUTSIDE the engine's import graph; the engine receives them as values.
- **No scheduler:** time is a column (`next_run_at`); the worker's `SKIP LOCKED` poll is the only
  clock consumer. Waits cost nothing; escalation is `blocked_deadline`, one column not a service.
- **Testing:** the whole failure matrix runs offline on stdlib sqlite with `FakeClock` and fake
  steps — zero domains attached. Postgres is the production dialect (see `schema.sql`).
  `pyproject.toml` is what puts that suite in CI: `gate:python` discovers a tree by `pyproject.toml`
  + `tests/`, so `make test` and the gate now run the same thing. `tests/test_contract_smokes.py`
  is the one exception — it asserts the LIVE stack shapes and skips itself when the stack is down.

Layering (dependency, not data): flows → domain HTTP APIs → runtime. Domains never know flows
exists — they only write outbox facts. Tactical retries (bot reconnects, webhook delivery) stay in
their components; strategic, crash-surviving coordination lives here.

## The mailbox is a door on the public internet

`src/flows_integrations/mailbox.py` turns real mail into facts, and `mail_policy.py` decides who
it will act for BEFORE it does. Three populations, and only the first two cost anything:

| sender | what happens |
|---|---|
| a known user | routed as before — the account already exists because they made it |
| inside `VEXA_FLOWS_MAIL_DOMAINS` | a colleague at this deployment's own domain, provisioned as before |
| anybody else | no account, no agent turn, no model call — one `mail_quarantine` row, and at most one fixed line (a template, never a model) |

**Unset is not "everyone".** An empty allow-list means the mailbox's own domain, exactly as an
unset `VEXA_FLOWS_ATTENDEE_DOMAINS` means the organizer's (PRD §16.2 — *outside the domain,
never*). `In-Reply-To` still says which conversation a reply belongs to and never says who the
sender is: a reply runs a turn only for that thread's own participant. An invite from an organizer
we cannot place records the meeting facts in the quarantine row and creates nothing (PRD decision
19 — *the workspace is established on the click, never for someone who never clicks*); a known
user can have it re-admitted through the operator's `POST /events`.

Two ceilings bound what the inbox can cost even when every sender is legitimate:
`VEXA_FLOWS_MAIL_RATE_PER_SENDER` and `VEXA_FLOWS_MAIL_RATE_GLOBAL` over
`VEXA_FLOWS_MAIL_RATE_WINDOW_S`, counted on ADMITTED turns in `mail_turn` — so a flood of
strangers cannot exhaust the budget of the people who are allowed to use this.

An inbound body that IS allowed through is quote-stripped and length-capped at
`VEXA_FLOWS_MAIL_BODY_MAX` (default 4000) before it travels as `mail.reply`'s `text` ref —
`mailbox.strip_quotes`, quotes off first so a reply does not spend its budget on text we sent
ourselves, and an explicit elision marker naming the control when it cuts. The text itself is
never altered otherwise. The *framing* half — the fenced, untrusted-labelled block with the
machinery note after it — belongs to the flow that puts the text in front of an agent
(`email_chat`, in `flows_defs/production_agent.py`), so a deployment that carries no agent domain
applies the cap and never builds a prompt at all.

## What is waiting is flows

`GET /queue/waiting` answers, for ONE person, what this engine is holding for them: the pending
reactions scoped to their uid AND their address, each naming the flow that produced it and carrying
a typed reason — `human` (blocked on an answer), `failed`, `not_present` (a domain this deployment
does not run, PRD decision 40.7), `pending`. PRD decision 42.2: *what is waiting IS flows*, so
nothing is unioned at the edge and no other domain contributes items — they publish events, and
flow definitions decide what waits. The projection is `src/flows_queue.py`.

Three flows exist for no other purpose than to put a row in that queue: `live_meeting` (a call is
happening now — pending until `meeting.completed` for the same meeting is admitted), `desk_setup`
and `desk_claim` (the two desk cards, both `needs=("agent",)`, so a deployment without the agent
domain has neither the events nor the reactions — there is no desk there to have a card on).

`desk_setup` and `desk_claim` react to `desk.unscaffolded` and `claim.proposed`, which flows
CONSUMES and does not publish — they are the agent domain's to publish, and they are deliberately
absent from this domain's `publishes_events` for that reason. The producer is agent-api: the first
on the call that CREATED a desk carrying no `.scaffolded`, the second at `POST /api/claims`, a
claim-aware route that owns the claim book and publishes one event per claim it actually added,
which is why that route exists at all. **Neither route, nor the publish-edge declaration that
carries them, is in this cut of the repository** — the agent-api control plane that serves them is
not here — so both entries in `contracts/flows.v1/carriers.json` are marked
`"published_by": "private"`, and `tests/test_carrier_census.py` checks that the mark is honest:
a carrier claiming it must have no declaration in this tree, so the flag comes off by force the
moment a producer lands here. The two consumer flows are likewise in the optional
`flows_defs/production_agent.py`. Both halves absent together is the deployment that carries no
agent domain, and not a gap in the queue.

**The words are not in the code.** Every sentence a person hears is a file in `behavior/queue/`,
resolved private-mount-first and read hot, and a pending reaction behavior says nothing about is
counted rather than spoken. `behavior/queue/README.md` is the contract.

## Two tiers at the door

`flows-api` answers to two kinds of caller and the difference is who the answer is about.

The **operator key** (`X-Flows-Operator-Key`, `VEXA_FLOWS_API_KEY`) is the instance: it opens every
route, reads every reaction and steers any of them. It is what configures the machine, and there is
no per-person version of `POST /flows` or `POST /events`.

A **person's own Vexa credential** opens the five routes that are about a person — `GET /flows`,
`GET /reactions`, `POST /reactions/{id}/{verb}`, `GET /queue/waiting`, `GET /timeline` — and the
subject is derived from
that credential by asking identity's `/internal/validate`, the same resolver the gateway asks. Not
a second resolver: flows is a second caller of the one that already exists. This is what the MCP
edge needs, because that edge forwards the caller's own credential and holds none of its own — so
without it the only way to make flows' four tools answer was to hand the edge the operator key, and
the operator key is not a person.

The header used to be `X-Flows-Admin-Key`, which reads as admin-api's token and is not one — a lane
start script carried a `changeme` for it because whoever wrote it exported admin-api's key under
this service's name. The old header is accepted for one release, with a deprecation line printed
once per process; a caller sending both is answered on the new one.

An unreachable identity answers **503**, never 401: not being able to ask who somebody is has not
established that their credential is bad.

## Meetings is optional, and so is the agent domain

Two of the three domains flows can reach are **capability** doors, and their absence is a shape of
deployment rather than a misconfiguration (PRD decision 40.7; decision 5 for meetings, agreed by
the founder). Unset means *that domain is not deployed*: the process boots, admits facts and serves
its queue, and the steps that would have reached the absent domain answer `<domain>:not_present` —
terminal, with the reason on the reaction, never a retry loop against a door that is not there.

| domain | key | steps that declare it |
|---|---|---|
| agent | `VEXA_FLOWS_AGENT_API_URL` | thirteen, listed in `tests/test_no_agents.py` |
| meetings | `VEXA_FLOWS_GATEWAY_URL` | `await_start` · `dispatch_bot` · `run_meeting` · `process_meeting` · `email_minutes` · `email_attendees` · `drop_to_attendees` · `prepare_meeting` |

**Presence is a configuration fact, never a probe.** A health check would make *"meeting-api is
restarting"* and *"there is no meeting-api"* the same answer, and only the second is a supported
product — the first is an outage, and it keeps the retry path it has always had.

Two things a reader should not have to discover. The meetings key still says **GATEWAY** because
flows reaches meetings *through the edge* today, which ADR-0037 forbids and which is a separate
change: the gateway resolves the caller's key and enriches every forward with the user's scopes,
workspaces and **limits**, and `POST /bots` enforces the per-user concurrent-bot cap out of that
last one — so calling meeting-api directly is not a rename. And the door resolves **at access**,
never at import (`flows_steps.common.meetings_door`): `from .common import GATEWAY` used to run the
refusal while `flows_steps/meeting.py` was still loading, so an unset door was an ImportError for
the whole step vocabulary, including every step with no interest in meetings.

**The class change does not close flows' `gate:domain-doors` entry, and the gate is right.** That
gate refuses a domain naming an EDGE before it looks at any class, so the entry closes on the
de-hop above and on nothing else; `scripts/domain-doors.allow.json` now says so, in place of a
ruling that promised this change would close it.

## Configuration

Every environment key this brick reads is declared once in `src/flows_config.py`, with its class
(`required-explicit` · `defaulted` · `capability`), its default and why it exists.
`tests/test_config_declaration.py` asserts BOTH directions — nothing read that is not declared,
and nothing declared that nothing reads. `core/flows` is not yet one of the five `config.v1`
adopted services (seam backlog B7/B9); this table is what makes that adoption a transcription.

## Carrying flows this repo does not publish

A deployment with flows of its own — a private onboarding ladder, a billing gate, anything — plugs
into the same engine and the same queue through three seams. Nothing about them is a fork of this
tree, and none of them lets a pack edit what is already here.

**1 · Flow versions as data.** `POST /flows` writes a `flow_version` row and the worker hot-loads it
within one refresh (`Registry.refresh_from_db`). Steps are referenced by NAME against the image's
reviewed vocabulary, and an unknown name is refused — the API never accepts code. So a flow that is
a re-ordering of steps that already exist needs nothing below.

**2 · Steps of its own — `VEXA_FLOWS_DEFS_EXTRA`.** Comma-separated importable module names, each
exposing `build(reg, db)`, called last by `flows_defs.production.build` — after every flow in this
repo, so a pack composes on top and supersedes nothing. This is the seam that seam 1 deliberately
does not provide: the vocabulary stays closed to the API and open to the operator, the same split
`VEXA_BEHAVIOR_DIR` already draws for prose.

```python
# acme_pack.py, on the deployment's own PYTHONPATH
from flows import Done, EventType

def build(reg, db):
    @reg.step
    def acme_step(ctx):
        return Done({"ok": True})
    reg.flow(name="acme", version=1, on=EventType("acme.happened"),
             steps=[reg.steps["acme_step"]])
```

A module named here and not importable is a **refusal to boot**, not a fallback: a deployment that
declares a pack and starts without it reacts to none of that pack's events, silently, for as long
as nobody looks.

**3 · Its own words — `VEXA_BEHAVIOR_DIR`.** `flows_queue` reads `$VEXA_BEHAVIOR_DIR/queue/<flow>.
<type>.md` before the showcase baked into the image, so a pack ships the sentences for its own flows
in that tree. A flow with no file is **counted and not spoken** — the copy is also the filter.

**Event types need no declaration.** There is no carrier allow-list on the intake: `POST /events`
refuses a type only when no flow reacts to it, and answers with the list that would have worked.
Register a flow on `acme.happened` and that type is admissible the same tick.
